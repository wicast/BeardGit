/**
 * Nerd Font glyph guard.
 *
 * The icons in this UI are private-use codepoints (U+E000–U+F8FF) from
 * Symbols Nerd Font, written literally into `.svelte` files. They are
 * invisible in most terminals, most diffs and most review tools, and an
 * edit that drops them leaves markup that is still valid Svelte, still
 * typechecks, still lints, and still passes every test — the icon column
 * simply renders blank.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical: a scripted edit to `WorkdirTree.svelte`
 * replaced all three of its folder glyphs with empty strings, and the
 * whole gate plus a re-rendered marketing screenshot went green over it.
 * The regression was caught by a human reading the picture.
 *
 * So this pins the glyphs per file, as a multiset of codepoints: every
 * codepoint a file had, it must still have at least as many of. Adding
 * icons is free; losing one is a failure with the file name and the
 * codepoint attached.
 *
 * It used to pin a bare count per file, which left the obvious hole: swap
 * a folder glyph for a chevron and the total is unchanged, so the check
 * passed while the icon column was wrong. A count cannot tell "the icons
 * are intact" from "the icons were shuffled". Codepoints can, and the
 * error message can then name what went missing instead of just how many.
 *
 * **All three ways of writing a glyph count the same.** A literal
 * character, a `` escape, and an `&#xF07B;` HTML entity are the same
 * icon to a reader of the running app, so they are the same icon here.
 * Counting only literals would have made this check *punish* the fix for
 * its own root cause: rewriting a literal as an escape — which is the one
 * form a careless edit cannot delete invisibly — would have read as three
 * lost glyphs.
 *
 * Update the baseline with: npm run check:glyphs -- --write
