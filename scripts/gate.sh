# The local CI gate, in one place, versioned.
#
# This file exists because the gate used to live only in `CLAUDE.md`, which
# is gitignored in this repo (`.gitignore` → `**/CLAUDE.md`). The list of
# checks, and the reasons behind them, therefore existed on exactly one
# machine and travelled to no other clone. The lesson that produced this
# script is the same one that produced `rust-toolchain.toml`: when the
# definition of "green" lives somewhere CI cannot see and other clones do
# not get, it drifts, and the drift is invisible until something is red for
# eight merges.
#
# Run it before claiming green:
#
#     npm run gate              # everything
#     npm run gate -- --fast    # skip the slow suites (see FAST_SKIP below)
#
# Auto-fix-and-claim-green is not acceptable — fix the underlying issue.
#
# Note the division of labour with CI: CI runs these same checks, but split
# across parallel jobs and a 3-OS matrix (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), so it
# is deliberately *not* a call to this script. Two things follow. Adding a
# check here does not add it to CI, and `tests/visual` runs here and not in
# CI at all — its 98 baselines are macOS-only, so CI only asserts the specs
# still load.
