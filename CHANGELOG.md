# Changelog

All notable changes to BeardGit are documented here. Format follows [keepachangelog.com](https://keepachangelog.com).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **"Reveal in file manager" now opens the file's folder on Windows instead of a bare Explorer window.** The context-menu entry in the Changes list, the commit detail file list, and the editor file tree all pass git's repo-relative paths (forward slashes), which the command joined onto the project root. `PathBuf::join` on Windows only inserts its own separator between the two halves and leaves the rest untouched, so Explorer was handed `/select,C:\repo\src/lib.rs` — a mixed-separator path it cannot resolve for `/select,`. Explorer silently falls back to its default view (Quick access / This PC), which is exactly the "opens Explorer but not the file's location" symptom. The path is now normalised to backslashes before it reaches Explorer. Opening a folder — including the project-folder button in the top-right — was unaffected, because Explorer accepts any separator for plain navigation; macOS (`open -R`) and Linux (`xdg-open`) were unaffected too.
- **Revealing a file that no longer exists opens its containing folder instead of failing.** The Changes view and commit details list paths that may have been deleted or renamed since — a deleted file, a file from an old commit, the pre-rename side of a rename — and the command aborted with a "path not found" toast whenever the path was gone, even though the folder around it was still there. It now walks up to the closest path that still exists first.

## [26.9.0] — Sections that remember, an editor that keeps its place, and a graph that draws what git did — 2026-09-03

### Added

- **Every section remembers where you left it.** Leaving a view and coming back used to reset it: the filter you had typed in Branches, the folders you had collapsed, the split you had dragged, the comment you were halfway through on a merge request, the message in the commit box. Each section is one component that unmounts when you leave, so anything it held in local state was simply gone. That state now outlives the section for the length of the session — filters and scroll positions in every list, panel widths in the nine split views, the collapsed groups and folders of the branch tree, the search chips in Graph / MRs / Issues / Pipelines, the drafts (commit message and amend toggle, stash message, new submodule, bisect good/bad refs, MR and issue comments keyed by item, repo-config labels and protection rules), the Report/Transcript sub-tab and split of AI sessions, and the job-log pane of Pipelines. Repo-specific state is kept per project tab and dropped when the tab closes; layout is kept once for the app. Nothing is persisted across a relaunch. The commit draft moved into the per-repo state along the way, so switching project tabs no longer swaps one repository's half-written message under another.
- **The editor keeps its tree and tabs across views and project tabs.** Switching to another section and back collapsed every folder in the file tree and re-read every open tab from disk — dropping unsaved edits — because the panel remembered which project it had loaded in a variable that died with it. The editor store now owns that, with a per-project session cache: a remount for the same project is a no-op, a different project swaps its parked tree, expanded folders and tabs back in, corrects the listings and clean buffers against the disk without blanking anything, and leaves dirty buffers exactly as they were. A file opened "in editor" from the Changes view before the panel has ever mounted is adopted by the project that loads next rather than filed under the previous one.
- **Reveal the active file in the tree.** New editor preference, on by default: when the active tab changes, the tree expands the file's ancestors — listing the ones it had not visited yet — and scrolls the row into view. Off while the tree filter is active, since the flat result list has nothing to expand.

### Fixed

- **A merged branch's lane no longer runs to the bottom of the graph.** When two lanes were both waiting for the same parent commit, the one that did not get to draw it was never released: its segment stayed open and painted a vertical line with no commits on it down to the last row, or until the lane cap forced a reclaim. Under every merged branch. The lane now closes at the row above the parent and is free for reuse, and cached layouts are rebuilt once.
- **Merge curves and the lines they hand off to agree on where they meet.** Three artefacts from one disagreement. The segment starting under a merge was clipped with an arrival point computed one way while the curve was drawn another, leaving a stub on the parent's lane that nothing connected to. A merge pulling a parent into a fresh lane now bends at the top, into that lane, in that lane's colour and group — it used to bend at the bottom in the child's colour and change hue where the segment took over, and hovering or dimming the branch left its first bend at full strength — while a branch rejoining an existing line bends at the bottom, and its segment stops where the curve begins to bend instead of poking out below it as a spike. Which curve opened a lane is now decided by the layout, not guessed by the renderer from "a segment starts here": a merge whose two parents landed on the same lane matched that guess twice, and the first-parent edge was painted over the other lane's line, leaving the merge's own line — `master`'s, in the report — ending in mid-air.
- **Ref badges are the same colour in the graph and in the commit detail, and the theme's ref colours are honoured.** Badges were coloured by a hash of the ref name — the canvas over the lane palette, the detail pane over five accent tokens with a different modulus — so one branch had two colours, and a branch could share its colour with an unrelated lane. The theme's `ref_branch` / `ref_remote` / `ref_tag` fields were loaded and never read. Both now colour by kind: local branch, remote, tag, HEAD, from the theme, which also publishes them as `--graph-ref-*` tokens for DOM badges. A badge whose theme colour was `rgb()` or short hex also stopped vanishing on the canvas: its alpha was produced by appending two hex digits to the string.
- **The editor's file tree follows symlinks.** A symlinked directory or file was skipped outright. It now lists as what it points at — a linked directory expands to the target's children — and only dangling links are dropped. The tree filter's walk does not descend into linked directories, so a link back up the tree cannot send it in circles.

### Changed

- **The AI actions send their prompt over stdin, and say less.** The five specialised actions — commit message, review, and the rest — handed Claude Code their whole prompt as a single command-line argument, staged diff included, which the provider crate itself documented as truncating past the platform's argv limit; a large diff came back reviewed in part. Providers that read stdin now get the prompt piped. The prompts themselves lost the pressure language written for older models ("Output ONLY", "Be thorough") and the review prompts state the output shape, since the reply is saved as a Markdown file. Codex and OpenCode keep the argument form.
- **Typing in the editor is lighter, and the completion popup opens sooner.** Every keystroke wrote the buffer into the tab store from inside CodeMirror's update listener, before the character painted, re-rendering the tab strip and toolbar per key and rebuilding the whole extension array because a derived value watched the tab object rather than its path. The store now catches up 100 ms after the last keystroke, or immediately before anything reads the buffer (save, tab switch, close); the extensions rebuild only when the file changes. The autocomplete popup's typing delay drops from 100 ms to 30 ms.

## [26.8.0] — Themes you can read, three data-loss fixes, and an updater that finishes — 2026-08-28

### Added

- **11 new themes, and every bundled theme now passes a contrast audit.** Rosé Pine (Moon / Dawn), Everforest (Dark / Light), Kanagawa, Ayu (Dark / Mirage / Light), Material, Zenburn and Oxocarbon take the built-ins from 20 to 31. They arrived with a WCAG contrast check that the theme derivation had always claimed to run and never did — measuring the existing themes found 25 tokens below the readable floor across 13 of the 20, and the worst of them were not merely quiet but unreadable: gruvbox-dark at 1.67:1, nord at 1.69:1, one-dark at 1.90:1. All three text rungs now clear 4.5:1 on every bundled theme, pinned by a test. A theme you wrote yourself is reported, never rewritten: the picker lists which tokens fall short and by how much, and applies your theme regardless.
- **Collapse a hunk, expand the whole file, open it in the editor.** The Changes view had no collapsed state at all, so a file with a dozen hunks was a dozen hunks of scrolling to reach the one you cared about — each hunk header now has a chevron, and the toolbar a collapse-all that flips to expand-all. Seeing the rest of the file needed the backend: libgit2 keeps three lines of context around each change and nothing had ever asked it for more, so the surrounding code simply was not in the payload. The toolbar's expand control re-fetches the file as one hunk, and the context survives a background refresh. Each row also gets a pencil that opens it in the editor, and `Mod+E` opens whatever the diff pane is holding.
- **Log level is now a setting, and the log has something in it.** The log file had one line in it: 165 `#[instrument]` attributes created spans that the formatter was never told to print, and the level was fixed at startup with no way to change it. Settings → Advanced now switches between error, info and debug live, persisted across restarts, and the events that make a bug report answerable are there — project open/close/switch, watcher start, mutation fan-out, task start/finish with exit code, and every IPC failure from a single chokepoint. Prose, URLs that can carry a credential, and shell input stay out of the file by construction.

### Fixed

- **Per-line staging staged the lines you picked, not the ones at those indices.** A line selection is positional — hunk 2, lines 5–7 of what the pane rendered — and the backend threw that diff away and re-derived its own at libgit2's fixed three lines of context. The two agreed right up until "show whole file" let the pane ask for the file as one hunk; from then on the same indices named different lines on each side. Tick a line, press Stage, get a success toast, and a different line was staged. Discard destroyed the wrong lines, or failed with a corrupt-patch error, depending on the shape. Two clicks from the Changes view, and it survived navigation. All three staging paths now re-derive the diff at the context the selection was built against.
- **Discarding or unstaging a single line works again.** Both failed every time: `git apply` rejected the patch, the target was left untouched, and you got an error toast. The rule for what to do with a *non-selected* changed line was written for a forward patch, and these two paths apply with `--reverse`, where the polarity is the other way round — so the patch described a state the file was not in. Safe, but the action was unusable.
- **Installing an update dead-ended on macOS and Windows.** The install flow set a re-auth notice and returned early, and the dialog meant to carry that notice was never mounted by any route — so the toast disappeared and nothing was ever installed. Linux was the only platform where updating worked. The gate is gone: the download starts immediately, and the unsigned-build notice moved into the surfaces you see *before* installing, since the Windows installer kills the app mid-install and nothing shown after the download would ever be read.
- **Discarding an untracked symlink no longer deletes what it points at.** Discarding resolved the path before deciding what to remove, and resolving a symlink follows it — so discarding a link that pointed at a tracked directory ran a recursive delete on that directory, wiping committed files, while the link itself stayed put and the app reported success. A link pointing outside the repository took the opposite path: the containment check skipped it, so nothing was deleted and you were told it had been. Discard now classifies the entry without following it, so a symlink is removed as a link whatever it points at, and a delete that is attempted and fails comes back as an error naming the paths still on disk instead of reporting a clean working tree.
- **An interactive rebase left open while HEAD moves no longer drops the new commits.** The rebase plan is a snapshot taken when the editor opens, and nothing rechecked it before running. `git rebase -i` applies exactly the todo list it is given and silently discards every commit missing from it, so if anything moved HEAD while the dialog was open — a commit from a terminal, a pull, an AI background run — submitting the plan erased those commits from the branch. The plan is now re-checked against the current range and refused if it no longer covers it, with a message telling you to reopen the editor. Marking a commit `drop` is unaffected. Planning a rebase over more than 1,000 commits is now refused up front rather than truncated, for the same reason: a shortened list would be a shortened todo file.
- **Background work now shows up in the tasks popover — and a failed tag push finally says so.** Eight operations that already ran as background tasks never appeared anywhere: pushing a tag, pushing all tags, updating a submodule (and updating all of them), checking out a merge request or pull request, publishing a tag + release, uploading a release asset, and an automated bisect run. They spawned as untyped tasks, which the drawer deliberately filters out, so there was no row and no spinner on the status-bar icon. Worst of them was the tag push, which was silent twice over: it also never surfaced a failure, so a push rejected for lack of permission, an existing remote tag, or no network produced nothing at all, anywhere. All eight now produce a cancellable row, and a rejected tag push shows an error toast.
- **Bisect now works inside a linked worktree or a submodule, and external commits there refresh the view.** Both assumed `.git` is a directory. In a linked worktree it is a file pointing elsewhere, so the bisect state file was looked for at a path that never exists and the bisect UI simply never appeared with a session running. The filesystem watcher had the same blind spot from the other side: a worktree keeps its HEAD and index in one out-of-tree directory and its refs in another, and a commit touches neither the working tree nor anything the watcher was looking at — so committing from a terminal in a worktree refreshed nothing. Both now resolve the real git directory, and the watcher watches it.
- **A CI pipeline with more than 100 jobs now shows all of them.** The job list for a workflow run (GitHub) or pipeline (GitLab) asked for one page of 100 and never looked further, so a wide build matrix showed the first hundred jobs and said nothing about the rest. Both now follow pagination to the end, and log it if they ever stop at the safety bound.
- **A GitLab issue whose comments can't be loaded no longer looks like an issue with no comments.** The detail pane derived the comment count from the notes it fetched and fell back to an empty list when that fetch failed — a token without the right scope is the usual cause — which replaced the real count with zero. The issue list beside it still showed the true count, so the two disagreed: "5 comments" in the list, no comments section at all in the detail. The count now survives a failed fetch, and the pane says the comments could not be loaded instead of hiding the section.
- **The editor's file tree lists every folder, and stops going stale.** "I can't open the `main` folder, it isn't listed." The tree asked for the entire working directory capped at 10,000 entries, and the cap was applied to a depth-first walk that stopped dead wherever it happened to be — so it kept whatever the walk reached first and dropped the rest, directories included, and the folders that did survive arrived without their children and expanded to nothing. There is no tree walk left to budget: the tree now lists one level at a time and fetches a folder's children when you first open it. A refresh also drops its cached listings, closing the gap where a file created inside a collapsed folder was invisible until you switched projects, and a rename left the tree offering the old name.
- **Every theme's editor colours now actually reach the app.** The 15 `[editor]` tokens of all 20 bundled themes were inert: the Rust struct serialized them as `added-bg` / `syntax-keyword` / `gutter-fg` while the frontend read `added_bg` / `syntax_keyword` / `gutter_fg`, so every read came back undefined. The two diff-background tokens are the only ones with no derived fallback, which is why a light theme painted its added and removed rows in the dark defaults — the exact pixels in the reported screenshot. From the same pass: the scrollbar thumb and spinner track were hardcoded white at 15% opacity, which in every light theme is a white thumb on a white page.

### Changed

- **Cloning a repository and adding a submodule no longer freeze the window, and can be cancelled.** Both ran the clone inline on the UI thread, so the app was unresponsive for as long as the remote took, with no progress and no way to stop it — the dialog's own spinner couldn't even paint, because the thread that would paint it was the blocked one. Both now run as background tasks with a cancellable row in the tasks popover, and the clone opens its new tab when the task lands. Cancelling a clone leaves the partial checkout in place; retrying reports that the folder already exists rather than deleting anything for you.
- **Assorted performance work.** Two of the bigger ones, if you hit them: the Changes list and the commit-detail file list now render only the rows in view above 500 files, so a working tree with tens of thousands of untracked files (an unignored `node_modules`, say) no longer mounts a DOM node per file; and the working-tree file search — which runs on every keystroke in the file-editor search — moved off the UI thread along with four other measured-expensive commands, so typing no longer costs a frame per character. The rest were smaller and are not worth listing individually.

## [26.7.1] — Off the UI thread, per-tab state isolation, and broader error codes — 2026-07-03

### Changed

- **Opening diffs and refreshing the Changes view no longer compete with the UI thread.** The diff and file-content read commands — the working-tree and staged diffs (whole-tree and per-file), the cheap per-file change stats that back the Changes list, and reading a file's contents from a commit, the working tree, or the index — ran their `git2` work synchronously on the webview's main thread. On a large repo, opening a big diff or letting the Changes list refresh could stutter or briefly freeze the window. They now run on a background thread (`spawn_blocking`), keeping the UI responsive; results are unchanged. (`get_diff_workdir`/`get_diff_index`/`get_diff_file`, `get_diff_stats_workdir`/`get_diff_stats_index`, `get_file_at_commit`/`get_file_workdir`/`get_file_index`.)
- **More git actions now fail with a stable error code instead of raw text, and the "not a git repository" code is unified.** The typed `{ code, message }` error envelope — which lets the app react to *why* a command failed rather than parsing its message — now covers the common working-tree mutations: branch delete (single and batch), checkout, the stash family (push/pop/apply/apply-file/drop), merge, rebase, revert, cherry-pick, reset, branch rename, and tag create/delete. Three situations you act on differently now carry their own code and get a clearer toast: switching branches with uncommitted edits that would be overwritten ("Checkout would overwrite uncommitted changes — commit or stash first"), a safe delete of a branch that still has unmerged commits ("Branch has unmerged commits — delete with force to discard them"), and renaming a branch onto a name that's already taken ("A branch with that name already exists — choose a different name"). Opening a non-repository also reports one consistent code everywhere: `open_project` already used `not_a_repo`, but `open_repo` emitted a different `repo_not_found` for the identical situation and the frontend only recognised one of them, so that path fell back to raw text — both now use `not_a_repo` (the old code is still accepted as an alias). No behaviour changes for successful commands; only how failures are labelled.

### Fixed

- **The commit graph no longer jumps back to the top when a background change lands or when you switch tabs.** The graph reset its scroll to the very first row whenever the active repo's info was re-fetched — which happens on *every* background mutation (a commit, fetch, or checkout picked up by the watcher) and on every tab switch — so scrolling deep into history and then having anything refresh (or flipping to another tab and back) yanked you straight back to the newest commit, undoing the per-repo scroll position the graph now keeps. The reset now fires only when you actually switch to a different repository that has no cached view yet: a background refresh keeps your exact scroll position (reconciling if new commits landed above), and returning to a tab restores the offset and selection you left it at.
- **Checking out a commit (detached HEAD) over uncommitted changes now warns you instead of failing with a raw error.** Switching *branches* over a dirty tree already surfaced the actionable "Checkout would overwrite uncommitted changes — commit or stash first" toast, but checking out a specific commit shared none of that: it returned a generic `git` error code, so the UI couldn't tell you to commit or stash first. Detached checkout now maps the same libgit2 conflict to the `would_lose_changes` code, so both paths give you the same clear prompt.

- **The commit graph no longer forgets your selected commit when you switch repo tabs — and switching back is instant.** The graph's viewport, scroll offset, and selected commit lived in module-level stores shared by every open repo tab, kept in sync only by a hand-rolled per-path cache that was cleared on every switch. So opening another repo wiped the first repo's graph selection (its commit detail panel emptied), and coming back re-fetched and re-laid-out the graph from scratch. This state now lives per-repo in the RepoState container, so each tab keeps its own graph view and commit selection: switching tabs is a pointer swap — the cached graph paints immediately with no spinner or rebuild, and the commit you had selected is still selected. A commit-detail load that resolves after you've already switched tabs now lands in the repo it was started for instead of the tab you're looking at.

- **The Compare view no longer shows one repo's comparison in another repo's tab.** Starting a compare (or opening a per-file diff in it) in repo A and switching to repo B before the backend responded could paint A's merge-base, commit list, and changed files into B's Compare view — the stale-response guard was a module-level counter that nothing bumped on a tab switch, while the writes always landed in whatever repo was active when the response arrived. Each compare now captures the repo it was started for and writes its results back into that repo's own state, so a late response lands where it belongs and is invisible in the tab you switched to; the last-wins guard is now per-repo, so a newer compare in the same repo still cancels an older one. The same fix now covers the Compare view's "Load more" pagination: clicking it in repo A and switching to a repo B that happened to have the same base/compare refs could append A's next page of commits into B's list — it now appends into the repo it was started for.

- **The Requests panel no longer leaks its selection across repository tabs — and can't Send or Save against the wrong repo.** The selected `.http` file, its parsed request, the active environment, the run state, and the last response were held in module-level stores shared by every open repo tab. Because the panel doesn't remount on a tab switch, selecting a project-local request in repo A and then switching to repo B left A's file path selected while the Send/Save buttons used B's project path — so hitting Send wrote or executed the file in the *wrong* repository, and only a 10-second background poll eventually cleared it (and it missed same-named files entirely). This selection state now lives per-repo in the RepoState container, so switching tabs instantly shows that repo's own selection and every request is always sent and saved against the repo it belongs to.
- **The MR/PR and Issues views now keep their state per repository tab.** The pull-request and issue lists, their filter tabs, the selected item and its detail, the open per-file PR diff, and the label/milestone picker caches lived in module-level stores shared by every open repo tab — so opening repo B wiped repo A's list and selection, and switching back re-fetched everything from scratch (and a slow list or detail load that resolved after a tab switch could paint one repo's pull requests into another repo's view). Each of these now lives per-repo in the RepoState container: switching tabs is a pointer swap that instantly restores that repo's own MR/PR and Issues view, and a list, detail, or PR file-diff load that resolves after you've switched tabs lands in the repo it was started for instead of the tab you're looking at.
- **Each tab's at-a-glance status badges are now backed by that repo's own state, closing the last cross-repo cache.** The compact status pills on inactive tabs (↑ ahead, ↓ behind, ! modified, + staged, ? untracked, ⚑ stashes) and the cached commit-graph viewport that lets a tab repaint instantly on switch were read from a single app-wide `Map<projectPath, ProjectSnapshot>` — the exact "wrote active-repo data under an inactive repo's key" hazard that this cache had already been bitten by twice. That in-memory cache now lives per-repo in the RepoState container, reached only by a repo's own path, so a tab's badges and instant-paint graph can never be sourced from another repo's data. This completes the per-repo state migration (spec 08): with the graph, branches, changes, compare, requests, MR/PR, and Issues views already moved, no feature store keeps its own private per-path cache for tab survival anymore. (The unified tasks popover and AI background-runs list stay intentionally app-global — they aggregate work across every repo and carry no per-repo routing key.)
- **Staging, checkout, and branch cleanup/delete no longer freeze the window.** These commands ran their real work — index writes, `git add -A` working-tree walks, patch application, checkouts that rewrite the working tree, and the `git branch -d/-D` subprocess spawns (including the batch delete, which forks one process per branch) — synchronously on the webview's main thread, so staging a large change, switching branches on a big repo, or bulk-deleting dozens of branches would lock the UI until they finished. They now run on a background thread (`spawn_blocking`), keeping the window responsive; the mutation-driven refresh is unchanged. Same fix for opening the "Clean up branches…" dialog, whose candidate list is an uncached O(branches × divergence) graph walk that used to block the thread every time it opened. (`stage_files`/`unstage_files`/`stage_all`/`unstage_all`/`stage_hunks`/`unstage_hunks`/`discard_files`/`discard_hunks`, `checkout_branch`/`checkout_detached`, `delete_branch`/`delete_branches`, `list_branch_cleanup_candidates`.)

## [26.7.0] — Instant on huge repos, commit signing, a compare view, and branch cleanup — 2026-07-02

### Added

- **Push and Pull buttons show what's out of sync.** The top-bar Push and Pull buttons now carry a small count badge (↑N on Push, ↓N on Pull) in the corner and pick up the accent tint whenever the current branch is ahead of / behind its upstream — so you can see at a glance that there's something to push or pull without opening the status bar. Counts come from the same branch-vs-upstream data the status bar already tracks (refreshed through the mutation pipeline, no polling), the badge caps at "99+", and it's an absolutely-positioned overlay so the buttons never resize or shift. When there's no upstream, HEAD is detached, or you're in sync, the badge and tint stay off. The tooltip spells the count out ("Push — 3 commits ahead").
- **Commit signing (SSH/GPG/X.509) is now honored and surfaced.** If your git config has `commit.gpgsign=true`, commits created in BeardGit are now signed — creation routes through the git CLI (which drives your ssh/gpg/x509 backend and agent natively) instead of the libgit2 path that silently produced unsigned commits, so signature-enforcing branch protection no longer rejects your pushes. Amend, merge, revert, cherry-pick, and interactive-rebase squash/reword already went through the CLI and so sign automatically under the same config; AI-agent commits are made by the agent's own `git`, so they sign too. Signing runs non-interactively (`GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`) so a locked key fails fast with the real gpg/ssh error rather than hanging — agent-based setups (ssh-agent / gpg-agent) are the supported mode. When signing is not configured, nothing changes (the byte-identical libgit2 path is kept). The commit box shows a subtle "Will be signed (SSH/GPG)" chip, Git settings gains a **Commit signing** section with a **Test signing** button that signs a throwaway commit with your real config and reports success or the exact stderr, and the commit-detail pane shows a signature chip (present → lazily verified via `git verify-commit` on the open commit, cached per commit). Annotated tags are signed when `tag.gpgSign` is set (honored via config). Signature _verification_ renders git's verdict only; no trust-store management.
- **Branch cleanup: `[gone]` detection + bulk delete.** Local branches whose upstream was deleted on the remote (and pruned) now show a red `[gone]` chip in the branches list, alongside the ahead/behind pips. A new "Clean up branches…" action in the branches-view header opens a dialog with two grouped sections — **Gone** (pre-checked) and **Merged into `<default>`** (unchecked, since squash-merge workflows make "merged" incomplete) — each row showing the last-commit date and how many commits it holds beyond the target. Selecting and confirming deletes the whole batch in one command (one refresh, not N), with per-branch failures reported rather than aborting the run. Gone branches that aren't fully merged surface a "not fully merged" warning and require an explicit force acknowledgment before they can be deleted; everything else uses the safe `git branch -d`. Deleted branches remain recoverable from the Reflog view. Current, default, and worktree-checked-out branches are never listed as candidates.
- **Compare any ref against any ref.** A new Compare view answers "what does my branch add over `main`?" without leaving the app: pick a base and a compare ref (branch, tag, or SHA, with autocomplete), and see the commits the compare side adds (with an ahead/behind summary), the changed-file list, and a per-file diff — the same diff pane, binary/too-large handling, and status badges used elsewhere. Two range modes: **3-dot** (`merge-base(A,B)..B` — "what B adds", PR semantics; the default) and **2-dot** (direct `A..B` tree comparison), plus a swap button. The commit list windows with a "Load more" so a huge divergence doesn't flood the UI. It opens contextually — from the graph node menu ("Compare with HEAD…", "Compare with…"), the branches list menu ("Compare with current branch"), or the command palette ("Compare refs…") — and deliberately adds no sidebar item. All read-only.
- **Reorder tabs by dragging.** Drag any tab to a new spot in the tab strip: the neighbouring tabs slide aside to open a gap and the dragged tab eases into place on drop. A composite tab (a repo plus its linked terminals/worktrees) moves as one whole pill — the sections inside it keep their order. The new order is persisted across restarts. (Implemented with pointer dragging rather than HTML5 drag-and-drop, which drops silently in the desktop webview.)
- **Keyboard navigation and range selection in the Changes lists.** Arrow keys move a focus cursor within a list, Space toggles the focused file's checkbox, and Shift+Arrow or Shift+click select a range of files. Focus and ranges stay within a single list (Staged / Unstaged).
- **Stash selected files from the right-click menu.** Right-click in Changes → **Stash Selected (N)** stashes just the checked files (or the file under the cursor), untracked files included, leaving the rest of the working tree untouched.
- **Batch actions on a multi-file selection in the Changes right-click menu.** When two or more files are checked and you right-click one of them, the context menu grows a dedicated section that applies the git action to the whole selection at once: **Stage Selected (N)** / **Discard Selected (N)** on the Unstaged list, **Unstage Selected (N)** on the Staged list, plus **Stash Selected (N)** and **Copy Paths (N)** on both. Discarding confirms once for the whole batch ("Discard changes in N files?") and runs as a single operation (one refresh, tracked files reset and untracked files deleted together) instead of file-by-file. The single-file actions are unchanged when nothing is multi-selected.
- **CI now runs the frontend test suite and the Rust tests on all three platforms.** A dedicated `frontend-tests` job runs Vitest on every push/PR (a broken frontend test now fails CI), and the Rust `cargo test` job runs on a Linux + Windows + macOS matrix for pushes to `beta`/`main` (Linux-only for `feature/**` pushes and PRs, keeping iteration cheap). `fmt`/`clippy`/the trait-purity guard stay Linux-only.
- **Weekly performance benchmarks (`perf.yml`).** A scheduled (and manually dispatchable) workflow runs Criterion benchmarks for commit-walk (`git-engine`) and graph layout/viewport (`graph-builder`) over a generated synthetic repository — no external fixture required — and uploads the results as an artifact for trend tracking.
- **The IPC contract between the Rust backend and the frontend is now enforced.** An ESLint rule forbids importing `invoke` (`@tauri-apps/api/core`) anywhere outside `src/lib/api/`, so every backend call must go through a typed wrapper; and a new CI step (`scripts/check-ipc-contract.mjs`) fails the build if a Rust `#[tauri::command]` has no `tauri.ts` wrapper (or a wrapper points at a command that no longer exists). This closes the "silently drifted" gap that let the whole Requests feature bypass the contract.
- **Structured error codes across the IPC boundary.** New/high-value commands (`clone_repo`, `open_project`, `open_repo`, `push`/`pull`/`fetch`) now reject with a typed `{ code, message }` envelope instead of a bare string, so the frontend can branch on a stable code (`not_a_repo`, `auth_required`, `not_fast_forward`, `destination_exists`, …) rather than parsing error text. `errors.ts` parses both the new and legacy string shapes.

### Changed

- **Internal: backend crate decomposition (dev-facing, no behaviour change).** `app-core` shed three chunks of business logic to the library crates where they belong, keeping only thin `#[tauri::command]` glue; the IPC contract, command names, and payloads are unchanged throughout. (1) The remote-repository-settings logic (GitHub/GitLab `gh`/`glab` calls, JSON parsing, config diffing) moved behind a `ForgeRepoConfig` seam in `cli-provider`, with the shared data types (`Visibility`, `RemoteRepoConfig`, `RemoteRepoConfigPatch`, `BranchProtection`, `diff_config`) now living in the dependency-light `forge-provider` contract crate; `commands/repo_config.rs` shrank from 3,627 lines to ~310, and its ~55 forge-config tests now run under `cargo test -p cli-provider` without Tauri. (2) The AI background-run coordinator (queue, concurrency cap, worktree lifecycle, `pending_finishes`/`apply_task_finish` race handling, session registry) moved to a new tauri-free `ai-runner` crate, so its 19 tests run without Tauri; `app-core` keeps the Tauri event-sink bridge and command glue. (3) The structurally-identical worktree-discovery/cleanup, version parsing, and commit-attribution helpers duplicated between the `codex` and `opencode` provider crates collapsed into a new `ai-provider-common` crate parameterized by a `ProviderSpec`, so a fix lands once instead of twice (a worktree-cleanup bug previously had to be fixed in both); `claude-code` keeps its genuinely-different git-porcelain worktrees and richer attribution, sharing only the identical version-token scanner. Storage hardening from the same audit: the per-project snapshot cache key switched from `DefaultHasher` (unstable across Rust releases) to a stable SHA-256, and the SQLite commit cache gained a schema-version tag so an encoding change invalidates stale rows instead of misreading them.
- **Committing on a huge repo is now instant — the whole graph no longer re-lays-out on every change.** A plain commit, amend, checkout, or fast-forward moves one branch forward by a commit or two, yet every such action (plus every commit the filesystem watcher notices) used to re-walk up to 20,000 commits and rebuild the entire lane layout from scratch. That work is now incremental: when exactly one branch advanced on top of the current graph tip, the new rows are spliced onto the cached layout in place (O(new commits)) instead of rebuilding it. Anything that isn't a simple advance — merges, rebases, force-pushes, resets — still does a correct full rebuild, and the fast path is cross-checked against a full rebuild in debug builds so it can never drift.
- **Opening a repository and switching tabs are faster.** The graph layout cache used to walk up to 20,000 commits just to compute its cache key — on _every_ open, even a cache hit. The key now derives from cheap O(refs) material (ref tips + HEAD + the HEAD tree + a `.git/shallow` marker), so a warm repo opens without that walk. Opening also no longer scans the working tree twice, and persisting the layout no longer clones the entire graph before writing it.
- **Per-branch ahead/behind counts are cached.** Listing branches recomputed the ahead/behind divergence for every tracking branch on every refresh; the counts are now cached per `(branch tip, upstream tip)` and recomputed only for branches whose tips actually moved.
- **Scrolling deep into a huge history no longer slows down progressively.** Two linear scans on the scroll path are gone. (1) Streaming the next page of commits used to re-walk the graph from the tips and throw away everything above the scroll position, so each page got slower the deeper you went; a single-branch (first-parent) view now continues the walk from the last loaded commit instead, so a page 80,000 commits down costs the same as the first page (measured ~0.85 ms vs ~120 ms at depth 4,000 on a synthetic repo). Full multi-branch views keep the exact previous results. (2) Drawing each viewport used to rescan every lane line and merge curve in the whole graph on every scroll step; a row-range index (rebuilt transparently from the cache, no on-disk format change) now returns only the lines and curves in the visible window, so the per-scroll cost stays flat as graphs grow into the tens of thousands of merges.
- **Changes keeps your checkbox selection but clears the open file on exit.** Leaving and re-entering Changes now preserves which files you had checked, while resetting the diff panel so you come back to a clean view instead of the last file you had open. Each open repository remembers its own selection.
- **The Changes view no longer fetches every file's full diff on each refresh.** A regenerated lockfile, a minified bundle, or any large/generated file in the working tree used to freeze the Changes view and balloon memory, because every save streamed the full hunks of every changed file over IPC. The file lists now render from cheap per-file stats (name/status + add/del counts, shown inline as +N/-N), and a file's hunks are fetched only when you open it — so mutation refreshes stay tiny and instant regardless of working-tree size. The currently open file re-fetches automatically after a mutation.
- **Builds and installs no longer cause background CPU churn.** The filesystem watcher now understands `.gitignore`: a `cargo build`, `npm install`, or bundler writing thousands of files under `target/` / `node_modules/` used to wake a full repo scan (refs + stashes + worktrees + status walk) every half-second for the duration of the build. Those ignored paths are now dropped from each batch before any scan runs — if a batch touches only ignored files, nothing happens at all. Live refresh is unchanged for everything that matters: editing a tracked file, adding a new (non-ignored) file, external commits/branch switches, and edits to `.gitignore` / `.git/info/exclude` itself all still refresh instantly, including files re-included by a negation rule (`!keep.me`) and files matched only by a nested `.gitignore`.
- **The Requests panel now goes through the typed IPC layer and gains toasts.** All 22 `requests_*` calls (previously raw, untyped `invoke()`s spread across 12 components) now run through typed wrappers in `tauri.ts`; mutating actions — create/save, rename, delete, duplicate, and environment save/delete/secret-set — route through `runMutation`, so they show the same success/failure toasts (with a "See details" affordance) as the rest of the app instead of failing silently. Behaviour is otherwise unchanged; the panel's own tree-refresh flow is preserved.

### Fixed

- **The "Parent folder" field in the New File / New Folder dialogs is now editable.** It previously looked like a text field but was read-only, so you were stuck creating files under whatever folder the tree selection implied. You can now type a relative directory (e.g. `src/utils`), with autocomplete against the repo's existing folders, and leave it blank for the repo root. Typing a directory that doesn't exist yet creates the intermediate folders on the way. Input is validated inline — `..` segments, absolute paths, and illegal characters are rejected before submit — with the backend still enforcing the same rules. The Rename dialog is unchanged.
- **Right-click menus opened near a window edge no longer get clipped.** Context menus now measure themselves on open and flip/clamp to stay fully inside the window (with a small margin), so items near the right or bottom edge are always reachable — across every menu (graph, branches, changes, file tree, worktrees, submodules, requests, reflog, pipelines) and their submenus.
- **Your Changes selection is no longer lost when you work in another repo tab.** With several repositories open, checking files in one repo's Changes list, switching to another tab (or a background change landing in one), and switching back used to return an empty selection — the checkbox state was a single global store that got wiped on every tab switch. Per-repo view state (Changes selection, branch list, open staging diff, commit-message draft) now lives in one per-repository state container, so switching tabs is a pointer swap that restores exactly what each repo had. This is the first migration onto that container (branches + changes), which makes the whole "state leaked across tabs" class of bug structurally impossible for the migrated stores — a guarded two-repo isolation test locks the behaviour in. (Graph, MR/PR, issues, and the rest migrate in follow-up steps.)
- **Oversized and binary diffs no longer freeze or bloat the app.** Every diff/file-content path is now capped: a single file's diff stops collecting past 5 MB or 10,000 lines and is tagged truncated, binary files short-circuit before any line collection, and the workdir/index file-content endpoints enforce the same 5 MB + binary guard the commit path already had. The Changes and diff panes render a clear "diff too large to display" / "binary file — no preview" notice instead of hanging on a multi-megabyte payload. A whole-response budget (20 MB) further bounds the working-tree and staged diff list endpoints.
- **The UI no longer freezes during bisect.** Every bisect action (start, good/bad/skip, reset, state/log queries) shells out to git off the app's async runtime, so the window stays responsive — you can scroll the graph and use other commands while bisect works, even on large repos.
- **Automated bisect is now cancellable.** `git bisect run` executes as a managed background task that streams its output and can be stopped from the UI, so a slow or runaway test command no longer locks up the app until it finishes.
- **An AI background run can no longer get stuck showing "running" forever.** If the provider process finished in the instant before its task registration completed, the terminal event was silently dropped and the session never left the running state. The finish event is now buffered and applied as soon as the registration lands (mirroring the existing output-line buffering).
- **CI reliability on Windows and fresh runners.** The Rust test repos pin `core.autocrlf=false` so content assertions aren't broken by the runners' global CRLF conversion; the clone-pipeline test builds a well-formed `file:///` URL from Windows paths; and the Vitest CI job runs `svelte-kit sync` first so a fresh runner has the generated tsconfig. The Rust dependency audit ignores (with justification) two `quick-xml` advisories that have no upstream fix path yet — it fails again on anything new.

## [26.6.3] — Fix phantom rebase toolbar — 2026-06-30

### Fixed

- **A finished rebase showed a phantom Abort/Continue toolbar.** After a rebase completed, git removes its `rebase-merge/` / `rebase-apply/` state directories but leaves the `.git/REBASE_HEAD` ref behind. Conflict detection treated that leftover ref as an in-progress rebase, so the toolbar appeared and clicking Abort/Continue ran `git rebase --abort/--continue`, which failed with "fatal: no rebase in progress". Detection now keys only off the rebase state directories (what git itself uses), matching git's actual state. (Surfaced once interactive rebases started completing instead of hanging, in 26.6.2.)

## [26.6.2] — Rebase recovery, live change detection, and a Windows-safe version scheme — 2026-06-30

### Changed

- **Version scheme migrated to 2-digit-year CalVer (`YY.M.patch`, e.g. `26.6.2`)** instead of 4-digit (`2026.6.x`). Windows installer version fields cap the major component at 255, so a `2026` major silently broke the Windows NSIS auto-updater: the new build downloaded but the install never "took", leaving the client re-detecting and re-downloading in a loop (other platforms were unaffected). The release workflow now hard-fails any tag whose version is not strict semver with major ≤ 255, minor ≤ 255, patch ≤ 65535, so an un-updatable Windows artifact can never ship again, and it force-marks the published release as GitHub "latest" (GitHub resolves "latest" by semver, and this tag is numerically lower than the stranded `2026.6.x` tags).
  - **One-time manual update required.** Because no Windows-legal version can ever be numerically greater than `2026.x`, existing users on **any** prior build (`0.x` or `2026.6.x`) are asked to download `26.6.2` manually once. Auto-update resumes normally from `26.x` onward.

### Fixed

- **Interactive rebase could hang with no way to abort.** A rebase plan containing `squash`, `fixup`, or `reword` made `git rebase -i` open the commit-message editor; with no controlling terminal it blocked forever, so the command never returned, no refresh event fired, and the Abort/Continue toolbar never appeared. The rebase now runs with a non-interactive `GIT_EDITOR`, so it always completes (or surfaces its conflict) and stays recoverable.
- **Conflict state and submodules no longer refreshed in real time.** After the filesystem watcher migrated to the `project-mutated` event, conflict status (which drives the Abort/Continue toolbar) and the submodule list were still wired only to the legacy `repo-changed` event and stopped updating live. Both are now driven by the mutation dispatcher, so an in-progress rebase/merge surfaces its toolbar immediately and submodules track external changes.
- **Silent filesystem-watcher start failures are now logged.** If a repo's watcher fails to start (e.g. an OS watch-descriptor limit on a large tree), real-time refresh was disabled for that repo with no diagnostic. The failure is now logged so "changes don't appear live" reports are traceable.

## [2026.6.1] — Clearer hierarchy, a grouped sidebar, and a friendlier first run — 2026-06-18

A polish pass from a UX review of the whole app in both dark and light themes. Nothing changes how you work — the screens just read more clearly and a few rough edges are gone.

### More depth between panels

Panels, lists and toolbars now sit at visibly different levels instead of blending into one flat surface. This was most noticeable on the light themes, where the selected row and the current view were hard to pick out — both now stand out clearly in every theme.

### Consistent, colour-coded file status

Modified, added, deleted, renamed and untracked files show the same colour-coded badge everywhere — in Changes, in commit and stash details, and in pull/merge-request diffs. The plain "?" that used to show up for some files is gone.

### One consistent set of buttons

Actions across the app now share one look: one style for the main action, green for things like merge and approve, red for destructive actions, and a quiet style for everything else. The copper accent is reserved for the current view and the single main action, so it reads as meaningful rather than decorative.

### A clearer commit box

The commit message now has separate fields for a short summary and an optional longer description. The button tells you exactly what it will do — "Commit 3 files to main" — and, when it isn't ready, says why ("Enter a summary to commit") instead of just being greyed out.

### A grouped sidebar

The navigation is organised into groups — Workspace, History, Advanced, AI, and your connected forge — with the tools you use daily on top. You can still tidy the rail by hiding items you don't use; hide every item in a group and the group disappears.

### A welcome screen that shows what BeardGit does

Opening BeardGit without a repository now leads with what it's for and a quick tour of its features, a clear drop-a-folder area, shortcuts to set up a new repo or open the command palette, and your recent repositories as cards. The AI Sessions screen now has a button to start a run instead of just pointing you elsewhere.

### Up-to-date dependencies

Refreshed the bundled build dependencies to clear two newly-reported security advisories, so a fresh install ships free of known vulnerabilities. Nothing changes in how the app behaves.

## [2026.6.0] — Design identity overhaul: own themes, merged title bar, coherent diffs — 2026-06-13

A full design pass over the app, driven by a visual review of every view (the repo's 32 Playwright baselines, dark + light) plus live iteration. The goal: stop reading as a GitHub Desktop fork and become a product with its own identity — without breaking a single workflow. Every change landed as its own commit with before/after captures, and the full CI gate (`cargo fmt`/`clippy`/`test`, `svelte-check`, `vitest`, `stylelint`+`eslint`, 92 Playwright tests) is green throughout.

### Own theme families — BeardGit (copper) is the new default

Three original theme pairs join the built-ins, each with a dark and a light variant wired for OS auto-switching: **BeardGit** (near-neutral charcoal/paper surfaces with a copper primary accent — softened from an earlier warmer draft that read too gruvbox), **Fjord** (blue-slate with ice cyan) and **Nebula** (indigo with violet). BeardGit Dark/Light replace `github-dark`/`-light` as the default theme everywhere a default is wired (Rust constants, `AppConfig`, frontend bootstrap fallback, `:root` statics, test fixtures); the GitHub pair stays available in the picker, pinned to its authentic editor scheme so it looks exactly as before.

### Editors and diffs now follow the theme — 100%, by construction

Code views had a strong dissonance with the rest of the UI, with three root causes, all fixed. `derive_editor` hardcoded GitHub's diff backgrounds and leaned the whole syntax palette on blue — diff line backgrounds now blend the theme's own green/red over its background, and syntax spreads across the theme's ANSI palette (keyword red, string green, function purple, type blue, number yellow, property cyan). The CodeMirror theme bridge captured concrete colors at build time — it now emits `var(--token)` CSS custom properties (`--syntax-*`, `--diff-*`, `--editor-*`, written by `applyTheme()`), so every editor and diff surface follows the active theme live, with no rebuilds and nothing to forget to pass. And the staging diff in Changes — previously plain text — gained per-line **syntax highlighting** through the same lazily-loaded lezer grammars the editors use, with identical added/removed backgrounds, so both diff renderers finally speak the same visual language. The graph canvas' pre-theme fallback also derives from the `:root` tokens (no more blue-lane flash on startup), and the HEAD-lane tint follows the theme's primary accent instead of always blue.

### The tab bar is the title bar now

The native title bar duplicated chrome above the tab strip. On macOS the window switches to `titleBarStyle: Overlay` + `hiddenTitle` — the traffic lights float over the tab bar, which gains a left inset; on Windows/Linux, platform configs ship `decorations: false` and a new `WindowControls` component (minimize / maximize-restore / close, token-themed, close-hover red) renders at the bar's right edge. The bar was already a drag region; window-control permissions joined the capability set. Registering `tauri-plugin-os` on the Rust side (it was frontend-only, so `type()` always threw) fixes the platform detection this needs — and, as a bonus, the auto-updater's OS detection that had been silently falling back to "other". The git summary that lived in the window title (branch + `↑↓+!?⚑` counters) moved to a new status-bar slot, mutation-fresh and clickable into Changes. Tab pills got a polish pass for their new home: close buttons materialise only on the active/hovered tab, the focused segment of a composite tab carries an inset border, dividers calmed down — and the status chips no longer leak onto the active composite tab when a terminal segment has focus.

### A single design language for primitives and states

- **Checkbox & Switch primitives** — all 46 native checkboxes across 19 component files replaced: custom-drawn Checkbox for selection (staging lists, dialogs, pickers) and a role="switch" toggle for boolean settings, both keeping a real hidden input so keyboard/AT semantics are untouched. Native controls also stopped rendering light-mode on dark themes (`color-scheme` was never set, now synced per theme). Markdown task-lists in issue/PR/release bodies re-skin to the same checkbox visual.
- **Skeleton loaders** — list panels and every detail pane's first load sketch their incoming content (shimmer rows / heading+paragraph bars) instead of a centered spinner; spinners remain for point operations only. The status-bar tasks slot swaps its "sync" glyph (which read as a refresh button) for a checklist icon at rest and a real spinner ring while work runs.
- **EmptyState everywhere** — every "Select a X to view details" italic one-liner became the shared icon + title block (with CTAs where they help, e.g. "New Worktree"), and elevation got a system: two shadow tokens replace 27 ad-hoc box-shadows, master list panes sit one surface step above detail panes.
- **Typography** — all 641 hardcoded font sizes now reference the `--font-size-*` scale, and the graph canvas uses deliberate type: ref badges, SHA and date columns in Fira Code, prose in the system sans.

### Graph: first-parent view, branch scope, smoother curves, faster canvas

A full pass over the commit-graph pipeline (Rust layout engine → IPC → canvas renderer). Backend: a **first-parent layout mode** (follow each commit's first parent for a simplified 1–2 lane mainline), a **branch-scoped viewport** (walk only one ref's history; composes with first-parent for the "clean main history" view), **nearest-lane affinity** for merge parents (a merge's second parent takes the free lane closest to its child, cutting long horizontal curves and crossings), an **adaptive lane ceiling** (`max_lanes` parameter, 4–16) and a **hardened layout cache key** (covers commit count + HEAD tree so a `reset --soft` back to the same HEAD can't serve a stale layout). All keyed into the on-disk cache and serde-compatible. Frontend: toolbar controls for the first-parent toggle and a branch-scope dropdown; **smoother merge curves** (bend scales with lane distance, control points computed after clamping → no kinks); the lane ceiling wired to the viewport width (≤900px → 8 lanes, wider → 12); **redundant-redraw elimination** (a per-frame draw key skips repaints when nothing pixel-affecting changed — `reconcileViewport` hands a fresh-but-identical viewport on every mutation, the ResizeObserver fires with unchanged dimensions); and **row-indexed hit-testing** (the per-mousemove linear scan became an O(1) memoised row→node lookup). Two latent bugs fixed along the way: the scroll offset snapping to the top when a pull rewrites history above the anchor commit (instead of scrolling to an unrelated row), and the HEAD-lane tint dimming with the rest when a branch is selected (it hardcoded full opacity). DPR backing-store scaling was already correct.

### Copper branding, end to end

`src-tauri/icons/app-icon.svg` is now the single vector source of truth — a dark warm rounded tile with a copper rim and the bearded mark re-tinted to the theme palette. Every bundle icon (icns/ico/png/Android/iOS) regenerates from it via `tauri icon`; web favicons, the landing logo and the OG/social images follow the same palette, and the website accent moves from the old orange to copper.

### Interaction & ergonomics

The side-by-side diff gained a draggable **centre split** (20–80%, double-click recenters, keyboard-adjustable, session-sticky) while the bottom panel's outer edge stopped being a drag target — it now always sticks to the surrounding columns. Resize limits got laxer across the board (SplitView panes, the Changes sidebar and the pipeline split grow to 80% of their container; defaults unchanged). The collapsed sidebar shows section-name tooltips on hover/focus. Tab hover tooltips wait a calm 700 ms instead of 300. The status bar gained lateral breathing room and a clearer slot order (Tasks · AI · repo summary · forge · network). Graph and Worktrees no longer share a sidebar glyph.

### Fixes along the way

GitLab repo settings surfaced raw `401 Unauthorized` CLI failures as a cryptic error (and logged nothing) — auth-shaped failures now map to the authenticate CTA and the loader logs to the log file. The status-bar forge pill almost never appeared (the provider heuristic read remotes off a type that doesn't carry them; it now uses the live remotes store, refreshed on project activation) and the remotes store is hardened against non-array payloads — a poisoning that could take down the page's reactivity. Settings' "Look & feel"/"Diff display" headings rendered twice; issue rows wrapped long milestones into a one-character column; PR rows ran the date into the title. All fixed.

## [0.2.1] — Staging diffs that stay fresh + sidebar reorder that works everywhere — 2026-06-10

Patch release for three regressions reported right after 0.2.0 — two in the Changes view, one in the sidebar's edit mode. Each fix ships with regression coverage (dispatcher unit tests plus a new functional Playwright spec exercising all three flows, green under both Chromium and WebKit), and the full CI gate (`cargo fmt`/`clippy`/`test`, `svelte-check`, `vitest`, `stylelint`+`eslint`) passes.

### Unstaged files show their diff again

The staged/unstaged `FileDiff` stores feeding the Changes-view diff panel were only hydrated when the staging area mounted — plus by a `repo-changed` listener that has been dead since the watcher moved to the `project-mutated` pipeline. Any stage/unstage/commit or external edit after mount refreshed the _file list_ but left the _diff stores_ frozen, so clicking a file that changed state since mount resolved no diff and the panel stayed empty (most visibly for unstaged files). The mutation dispatcher now refreshes the diffs alongside the statuses on every `head_changed`/`status_changed` event, and the click handler falls back to a refetch whenever the clicked path is missing from the store — not just when the store is empty — closing the click-vs-refresh race.

### The selected file is highlighted in the changes lists

Clicking a file updated the diff panel but nothing in the staged/unstaged lists marked which file you were looking at — the rows had no selected state at all. The page-level selection (which already drives the diff panel) now flows down into both lists, and the active row paints the same tonal `--overlay-accent-blue` highlight the commit-detail file list uses.

### Sidebar (and rebase) reorder no longer relies on HTML5 drag & drop

Reordering the navigation in the sidebar's edit mode did nothing on Windows: with Tauri's `dragDropEnabled` on (required for the drop-a-folder-to-open welcome screen), wry's native drag handler swallows in-webview HTML5 drag sessions, so `dragover`/`drop` never fire — the reorder logic itself was fine. A new `pointerReorder` utility tracks plain `mousemove`/`mouseup` from the row's `mousedown` and hit-tests rows by their vertical band, never entering the native drag machinery, so dragging now works on every platform. The interactive-rebase editor used the same HTML5 pattern and was equally affected, so it gets the same treatment. Keyboard reorder (↑/↓ on the drag handle) is untouched, and each list keeps its drop semantics — the sidebar lands the item at the hovered row, the rebase editor inserts above the indicator line.

## [0.2.0] — Audit hardening pass + a resizable, selectable diff panel — 2026-06-08

A multi-agent code audit swept the whole workspace (20 Rust crates + the Svelte frontend) and surfaced 5 high-severity issues plus a long tail of medium/low findings. This release closes the high-severity set and the high-value remainder, each with a regression test, alongside one user-facing feature and a security dependency bump. The full CI gate (`cargo fmt`/`clippy`/`test` across the workspace, `svelte-check`, `vitest`, `stylelint`+`eslint`) is green.

### The bottom diff panel is now resizable on both axes — and selectable

The diff panel that hangs below the graph, branch, reflog and PR/MR views gained two ergonomic wins. Its drag-to-resize ceiling moved from 60% of the surrounding container to **4/5 of the window height**, so a tall diff can actually fill the screen, while a guard keeps the view above it from collapsing below 80px. It also picked up a **horizontal** resize handle on its right edge — a flex sibling outside the panel, so it never sits on top of the diff's own scrollbar — letting you narrow the panel and reclaim width. Both dimensions persist across view switches via a small `diffPanelSize` store, and the whole thing is now a single reusable `ResizableDiffPanel` component instead of the handle markup that had been copy-pasted across five call sites. And the long-standing annoyance that **you couldn't select text in a diff** is fixed: the global `user-select: none` (which suppresses the native context menu) never re-enabled selection on the read-only CodeMirror diff content, so the allow-list in `app.css` now covers `.cm-content` and the staging diff's `.line-content`. Copying a line out of a diff just works.

### Audit — correctness & data-integrity

The headline fix: **partial hunk staging corrupted patches for files with no trailing newline at EOF.** `build_patch` fabricated a `\n` on the final line and `collect_file_diffs` dropped libgit2's `\ No newline at end of file` marker, so staging, unstaging, _or discarding_ the last hunk of such a file produced a patch `git apply` rejected outright (surfaced as a generic failure). The marker is now preserved end-to-end, verified with a no-EOF-newline staging roundtrip test.

A plain **checkout to an existing branch never refreshed the UI.** Such a checkout moves only the symbolic HEAD (`head_changed`, but `refs_changed` stays false because the symbolic HEAD carries no OID in the snapshot ref map), and the mutation dispatcher only refreshed branches/graph on `refs_changed` — leaving the sidebar highlighting the old branch, the graph HEAD marker stale, and the title bar showing the wrong branch. The dispatcher now refreshes the branch list, graph, reflog and a freshly-added `get_repo_info` on any HEAD move, and external `git tag` mutations finally refresh the tags store.

The **merge editor silently discarded in-progress conflict resolution on a theme or dark-mode flip** — the mount effect rebuilt all three views (resetting accepted hunks + manual edits) whenever the theme changed, which an OS auto dark/light switch triggers on its own. It now rebuilds only when the merge inputs change. `switch_project` no longer strands the previous tab with `repo = None` when loading the target fails (it defers the unload until the load succeeds), the staging diff resets its line selection when the underlying diff refreshes (so a stale positional selection can't stage the wrong lines), `ConflictToolbar` keeps the editor open and toasts on a failed resolve-write instead of closing as if resolved, and interactive rebase blocks squash/fixup on the first commit and fixes a drag-reorder off-by-one.

### Audit — security hardening

The markdown sanitiser's `javascript:` filter was **bypassable via HTML-entity or whitespace obfuscation** (`java&#115;cript:`, `java&Tab;script:`) — and its output is injected via `{@html}` into attacker-controllable PR/MR, release and issue bodies inside the IPC-privileged webview. It now decodes entities + strips whitespace and **allow-lists URL schemes** (http/https/mailto) on `href`/`src` rather than denying one. The Requests `.http` engine's SSRF screen now checks the _resolved_ IP (closing DNS-rebinding + public-name-to-private-IP) and canonicalises IPv4-mapped IPv6 (`::ffff:127.0.0.1`), the project-scoped Requests file commands reject `..` path-traversal, and the AI-config path validator no longer creates directories before its scope check (and resolves `..` lexically). git ref/oid arguments (merge/rebase/cherry-pick/revert/tag/branch) now sit after a `--` separator so a leading-dash value can't be reparsed as a flag, and the AI-terminal launches that the earlier shell allowlist had broken now run through a dedicated trusted spawn path (the allowlist still guards webview-originated spawns).

### Audit — robustness, resources & UTF-8

Killed terminals are now reaped (`kill`/`wait`) instead of leaking zombie PIDs; the task-runner caps its per-task output buffer + finished-task registry and feeds stdin concurrently to avoid a large-prompt pipe deadlock; `AppConfig` saves atomically (temp + rename) and the commits-cache uses a transaction guard so an error can't poison the connection. The fs watcher now refreshes on `.git/index`, `packed-refs` and `FETCH/MERGE/ORIG_HEAD` (external staging, packs, and merge/rebase flows were previously invisible). A cluster of byte-index UTF-8 bugs that panicked or mangled non-ASCII input was fixed across the CI log preprocessor, the OSC-7 cwd decoder, the `.http` variable resolver, and a couple of `sha[..8]` slices. GitLab MR diffs now paginate + time out like the GitHub path, CI query filters are URL-encoded, and a 2xx response that merely exhausted the GitHub rate-limit quota is no longer discarded as a failure.

### Dependencies

`@sveltejs/kit` 2.59.1 → 2.63.1 and `brace-expansion` 5.0.5 → 5.0.6, clearing two moderate `npm audit` advisories (a `query.batch` cross-talk and a range-DoS); both stayed within the declared ranges, so only the lockfile changed.

## [0.1.13] — Per-theme accents, command palette, security & performance pass — 2026-05-12

### Themes finally have an identity

Every theme could already define its own ANSI palette, but every theme animated the spinner blue, painted the primary button blue, and ringed focused fields blue — because the components were hard-coded against `--accent-blue`. Dracula's signature magenta, Gruvbox's amber, Nord's frost-cyan only ever showed up in the graph lanes; the rest of the UI was uniformly GitHub-Dark-flavoured no matter what theme the user picked.

Each theme TOML now ships an optional `[accents]` block that maps three semantic slots — `primary`, `secondary`, `tertiary` — to one of the theme's existing ANSI colour names (or to a literal `#RRGGBB`). The block is opt-in: themes that omit it keep the legacy blue / magenta / green defaults so nothing visual changes for them. Seven of the bundled themes pick their identity in this release: Dracula → magenta, Gruvbox Dark → yellow, Nord → cyan, Solarized Dark → cyan, Tokyo Night → blue, Catppuccin Mocha → magenta, Monokai Pro → magenta. Resolved values flow through `DerivedColors` into three new CSS tokens — `--accent-primary` / `--accent-secondary` / `--accent-tertiary` — published by `applyTheme()` and shipped with safe defaults in `app.css` so the boot-before-theme-loads frame doesn't go un-styled. The migration is wall-to-wall this release: every CSS / inline-style `var(--accent-blue)` consumer across the 109 frontend files that referenced it now reads `var(--accent-primary)`, so picking a non-default theme like Dracula or Gruvbox Dark recolours the entire UI — focus rings, hover and selected-row highlights, link styling, sidebar active state, the merge-editor "ours" connectors, command palette, dialog primary buttons — not just the spinner and primary button. Status colours (`running` CI runs etc.) keep reading `--accent-blue` directly via `getThemedStatusColor`, so semantic-blue affordances stay blue regardless of accent choice.

### Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P)

The single biggest discoverability win the May 2026 UX audit asked for. A new `common/CommandPalette.svelte` overlay indexes the thirteen sidebar navigation views (graph, changes, editor, branches, tags, stashes, worktrees, reflog, bisect, submodules, AI config, AI sessions, requests) plus every registered keyboard shortcut whose action is fireable. Whitespace-tokenised match scoring — typing `stash list` will match "Show stashes" — Up/Down/Enter/Escape keyboard nav, mouse hover updates the highlighted row, executing closes the palette and defers the action one tick so dialogs and route changes don't fight the close animation. Driven by a tiny `commandPalette.ts` store so future entry-points (statusbar `?` slot, per-panel quick actions) can call `openCommandPalette()` without re-implementing state.

### Six performance wins on the libgit2 hot path

The release pass through the May audit produced six independent perf cuts in the backend, each with its own commit on `perf/backend` for forensic clarity. `git-engine::status_summary` swapped a `git stash list` shell-out for a transient mut `git2::Repository` driving `stash_foreach`, saving ~30–80 ms on every status refresh that fed the title bar; `commits::get_commit` skips the full repository-wide ref-map walk that previously made every "select commit" click O(refs); `diff::collect_file_diffs` caches the most-recent `(file_oid, idx)` pair in a `Cell` so the print callback stops allocating a fresh path string on every diff line — the bill that dominated big-file diffs.

A new `Repository::commit_full_diff(oid)` returns a path-keyed `HashMap<String, FileDiff>` from a single libgit2 walk, exposed as `get_commit_full_diff` (Tauri command) + `getCommitFullDiff` (TS helper). Detail panes can adopt it incrementally, replacing the legacy fan-out of N subprocess `git diff <oid>^..<oid> -- <path>` calls (each ~30–80 ms on macOS) with a single tree-to-tree comparison. `storage::commits_cache` swaps JSON-encoded `parents` / `refs` columns for ASCII Unit-Separator joined strings, dropping ~10 k `serde_json::to_string` calls on every cache warm-up; the migration to schema v2 wipes the cache because libgit2 rebuilds it on next launch faster than parsing both encodings forever. `graph-builder::GraphLayout::compute` now consumes the `Dag` by value via a new `into_ordered_nodes_with_parents` helper that returns a parent-only map alongside the moved nodes, removing five owned-field clones per commit on every layout rebuild. And `mutation-events::Snapshot::capture` opens the repo once instead of twice (the previous code reopened for `stash_foreach`, costing four opens per user mutation under `MutationGuard`) and stores a single-`u64` order-independent status fingerprint instead of a `BTreeSet<(String, u32)>`.

The earlier `perf(audit): apply 17 fixes from performance audit` lands under the same release umbrella — that pass focused on UI-side wins (clamp recomputations, virtualisation thresholds, debounce timings) and is preserved verbatim on `perf/audit-fixes`. SQLite WAL mode + `busy_timeout` were already on `beta` from the quick-wins pass; this release just consolidates them.

### Nine security audit fixes

The May audit produced eleven findings; nine close in this release, the tenth (Keychain-backed credential storage) is documented as a 3-5 day TODO in `crates/auth/src/machine_key.rs`, the eleventh (`sh -c` in `ai_background.rs`) was a false positive against `#[cfg(test)]` mock fixtures.

TLS verification flips strict by default for self-hosted forges. The previous behaviour silently disabled cert checks on every host that wasn't `api.github.com` / `gitlab.com` — a MITM with a self-signed cert on a corporate LAN could harvest PATs from any BeardGit instance pointed at `gitlab.company.com`. Public clouds are unchanged; self-hosted hosts now verify by default. A new `BEARDGIT_INSECURE_TLS=1` env var is the explicit opt-in for users with internal CAs (mirrors `gh`'s `GH_INSECURE`); public clouds ignore the opt-in.

The Requests panel learns to refuse loopback / RFC1918 / link-local / ULA targets and a short list of well-known cloud-metadata aliases (`169.254.169.254`, `metadata.google.internal`, `instance-data`, IPv6 loopback / ULA prefixes). Combined with `redirect::Policy::none()`, a malicious public host can no longer 302 a request bearing the user's `Authorization` header toward an attacker. `BEARDGIT_REQUESTS_ALLOW_PRIVATE=1` opts back in for legitimate internal-network use; tests pass `ExecuteOptions { allow_private_hosts: true }` directly so mockito on `127.0.0.1` keeps working.

The terminal manager allowlists shell, args, and env on every PTY spawn. `validate_shell` accepts only the auto-detected default, paths from `/etc/shells` (Unix), or a small built-in list (Windows); `is_safe_shell_arg` whitelists `-l|-i|--noprofile|--norc` (no `-c` and friends — those were the obvious code-execution primitive); `is_dangerous_env_key` filters `LD_*`, `DYLD_*`, `PATH`, `GIT_SSH*`, `GIT_CONFIG*` before they reach the spawned process. The auto-updater refuses to install a manifest whose version is not strictly greater than the current build, defeating the "signed-but-older manifest" downgrade vector that `tauri-plugin-updater` would otherwise accept. `git clone` rejects URLs containing control characters or whitespace before reaching `git`. Credential file writes are now atomic (write-temp + rename), so a crash mid-write can't corrupt every stored PAT. Logging redaction was already on `beta` from the quick-wins pass; this release adds it to the audit summary in the capabilities README.

The Tauri capability surface is now documented in `src-tauri/capabilities/README.md` with each permission's risk and the hardening plan. The `opener:allow-open-path` migration to a custom-validated command is sketched out for a future pass — currently `Bajo` severity, gated by CSP, but explicit so the next maintainer doesn't have to rediscover the gap.

### UX polish — ten quick wins + the bigger ergonomic plays

The audit's quick-wins pass landed early in this release cycle. A new welcome screen replaces the lonely Open button with paired Open + Clone actions, a "Recent" list (top 5 from `get_recent_repos`) that opens the project on click, and a hint pointing users at the cheat-sheet shortcut. The status bar grows a `?` slot in the right cluster that opens the keyboard shortcut overlay, so the feature is reachable without first discovering the bare-key shortcut. Error toasts are now sticky by default — `addToast({ type: "error", … })` no longer auto-dismisses unless the caller passes an explicit duration — and ship an optional `details` payload that surfaces a Copy-details action useful for stack traces a user wants to paste into a bug report. Time helpers (`formatRelativeTime`, `formatDate`, `formatDateTime`) migrate to `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` / `Intl.DateTimeFormat` keyed off Paraglide's active locale, so Spanish builds finally show "hace 5 min" / "7 abr 2026" instead of mixed English. A global `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` collapses animation and transition durations to ~0 ms, unblocking vestibular-sensitive users who had no escape hatch from the spinners and sidebar transitions. The resize handles between graph / diff / changes get a subtle hover tint, an active drag highlight, full keyboard support (`role="separator"` + arrow keys + Home), and double-click reset to the default size.

A new shared `EmptyState.svelte` (title + description + icon + optional action snippet) replaces three ad-hoc empty placeholders: the no-diff message in `+page.svelte`, ReflogView's right-pane placeholder, and BranchList's "No local/remote branches" rows (the latter were hard-coded English literals — now i18n'd via `branches_no_local` / `branches_no_remote`). New `Tooltip.svelte` primitive replaces the native `title=` attribute (~700 ms delay, no styling); IconButton consumers can opt in for a styled popover with an optional `<kbd>` shortcut chip. The context menu's `MenuItem` shape gains `tone: "danger"` so destructive actions paint themselves in `--accent-red`, visually distinct from safe rows; existing call sites are unchanged. Welcome screen accepts dropped folders — `tauri.conf.json` flips `dragDropEnabled` to `true` and `+page.svelte` listens via `getCurrentWebview().onDragDropEvent`, painting a dashed `--accent-primary` border during drag-over. Density tokens (`--font-size-{xs,sm,md,lg,xl}` and `--space-{1..6}`) join `app.css` for new components and progressive migrations.

### Plumbing

`fix(perf): drop async wrapper from vite.config` — the dev server's cold-start dropped from ~120 s to seconds because Vite was hashing the config statically again and reusing `node_modules/.vite/deps`; the async wrapper was forcing a fresh hash on every startup. `fix(detection): adopt user shell PATH on macOS/Linux GUI launch` makes the `gh` / `glab` / `git` binary detection survive when the user's `PATH` is set in `.zshrc` rather than the GUI launchd environment. `chore(deps): track workspace Cargo.lock and pin fix-path-env rev` finally checks the workspace lockfile in (it had been gitignored), and `fix(deps): resync package-lock — add missing nested picomatch/yaml entries` plugs a JS lockfile drift that was making `npm ci` fail on fresh machines. `fix(auth): apply cargo fmt to credential_file` is a formatting-only follow-up to the credential store work.

`feat(settings): toggle for diff line wrapping` — the diff viewer learns a per-user "wrap long lines" toggle in Editor settings, defaulting off so existing users see no change. `chore(release): embed READ_BEFORE_RUN.md in macOS DMG` ships the Gatekeeper-bypass instructions inside the DMG itself so first-run macOS users have the apology + workaround handy without needing the GitHub release page.

### Visual regression suite

The first end-to-end visual safety net lands this release. A Playwright harness in `tests/` boots the SvelteKit app with the Tauri IPC layer stubbed out — `tests/mocks/ipc.ts` shims `__TAURI_INTERNALS__.invoke` against deterministic fixtures (`tests/fixtures/{branches,changes,commits,issues,mrs,pipelines,prefs,repo,theme}.ts`) so renders are byte-stable across machines. `routes.spec.ts` snapshots all 32 sidebar route × theme permutations (dark + light), and a new per-component spec layer adds 52 more baselines covering the smaller surfaces — dialogs, popovers, toolbars, empty states, and the welcome screen variants. A short `tests/README.md` documents the mock contract and how to regenerate baselines when an intentional visual change lands. The harness runs headless so the snapshots can gate PRs without a display server.

### GitHub PR review comments — inline threads finally show up

The PR diff panel could already render inline review threads on GitLab, but on GitHub the comments layer was silently empty because `gh pr view --json comments` only returns issue-style top-level comments — inline comments live at a separate REST endpoint that nothing was fetching. The detail fetcher now follows up with `gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{n}/comments --paginate` and merges the inline comments into the same `comments` array, parsed by a new `parse_github_review_comment` that populates `path`, `line`, and stamps `discussion_id` with the root review-comment id (the `in_reply_to_id` of replies, or the comment's own id for thread roots). Replies posted from the diff panel composer now route through a new `reply_to_review_comment` Tauri command + `ForgeProvider` trait method that on GitHub POSTs to `/pulls/{n}/comments/{id}/replies` (the dedicated reply endpoint) so the new note groups with the existing thread instead of leaking out as a fresh standalone comment on the same line, and on GitLab POSTs to `discussions/{id}/notes` (the same shape GitLab's CLI helper has always used for thread replies). Thread resolution on GitHub still ships as a known gap — `resolveReviewThread` is GraphQL-only and the inline parser leaves `resolvable: null`, so the Resolve toggle stays hidden on GitHub PRs the same way it always has; the trait default returning `NotSupported` is unchanged. The frontend `onReply` callback drops the GitHub workaround (which had been re-using `postReviewComment` to fake a thread by reposting at the same line) and now passes the parser-stamped `discussion_id` straight through to the new endpoint.

### Post-merge polish

After folding `perf/backend`, `sec/audit-fixes`, `feat/ux-ui-themes`, and `feat/quick-wins` onto `beta` together, a quick pass cleans up the rough edges the integration surfaced. `git.push` moves from `Cmd+Shift+P` to `Cmd+Shift+K` (mirroring `Cmd+Shift+L` for pull) so the Command Palette can finally claim its conventional binding — push and palette had silently collided since the palette landed. `core:window:allow-start-dragging` joins the Tauri capabilities list, restoring the `data-tauri-drag-region` chrome on `TabBar` / `Toolbar` that had been throwing an unhandled-rejection on every drag attempt since the capability surface tightened. The `src/test/e2e/mr-pr-diff.test.ts` race fixes three stacked issues — the provider-disconnect reroute bouncing `merge-requests` back to `graph` (mocked `providerStatus` so `hasActiveProvider` is true), an unmocked `list_mr_prs` IPC that left `mrPrList` undefined and crashed the filter (returns `[]` from the mock), and an order-of-render race where `prFileDiff` resolved before `.diff-panel` was in the DOM (folded the DOM check into the same `waitFor`). Plus a one-line `rustfmt` fix to `crates/storage/src/logging.rs`.

### Landing page redesign

`docs(landing): marketing-driven refresh of the public site` plus a wave of follow-ups (Inter typography, Satoshi headline experiment, drop-cap section, fluid-responsive feature/screenshot grids, balanced section H2s, eyebrow weight bump, audience copy reframe so single-forge devs are first-class, README marketing-first rewrite with bilingual EN/ES + OG image generator). All landing-page only — zero impact on the app binary.

## [0.1.12] — In-app mini editor + per-file discard — 2026-05-05

### Editor — edit repo files without leaving BeardGit

A new "Editor" sidebar entry (between Changes and Branches) opens a split-pane mini editor: file tree on the left, tabbed CodeMirror buffer on the right. The whole point is to close the loop on the most common "I see a diff → I want to fix it" workflow without bouncing out to an external editor. Every other surface that lists workdir files — Changes, the per-file context menu on Branches' commit detail, and Reflog detail — gets a new **Open in editor** item that switches the active view and opens the path as a new tab. PR/MR and graph commit-detail file lists stay diff-only on purpose, since those files are at-commit, not workdir; opening them would silently swap content the user expected to see.

The editor is built on the same CodeMirror 6 stack as the diff / merge views, but with a one-way contract that hard-isolates its lifecycle from prop reactivity — typing into the buffer never re-runs the init effect, never tears down the live `EditorView`, and never loses focus mid-keystroke. The parent owns external content swaps (file load, reload) by bumping a `loadVersion` counter that threads into a `revisionId` prop; the editor swallows fresh content exactly when an external write happens. Every other prop change (theme, extensions, even a new `onChange` closure on every parent re-render) is invisible to the editor's lifecycle, which uses `onMount` / `onDestroy` rather than reactive effects for mount + tear-down.

The tree and tabs are bookended by a polished editing UX: `EditorTabs` shows a dirty `●` and an external-change `⚠` indicator per tab, supports middle-click close, and routes dirty-tab close attempts through a `ConfirmDialog`. `EditorToolbar` exposes a Save button that morphs into "Save and stage" in real time while you hold Shift — a `window` keydown / keyup pair listens at the global scope (with a `blur` reset for the held-modifier-while-switching-app case) so the affordance is visible without having to read a tooltip. Mod+S / Mod+Shift+S keymaps reach the same `saveActive` helper. An external-change banner offers Reload / Keep-my-version actions when the watcher reports a workdir mutation that touches an open buffer.

The `FileTreeView` itself is a stateful `PathTree` with a `SearchInput` filter, a reload button, and a context menu (Open / Rename / Delete / New file here / New folder here / Copy path) hooked into a single combined `PathDialog` for the create / rename flows with Windows-illegal-character + path-traversal validation. The tree is gitignore-aware behind a Settings toggle (off by default — gitignored files stay visible so users can edit untracked or build-output files; the description spells this out). Folder / file glyphs are wired through a Nerd Font map (`file-icons.ts`) keyed by basename and extension covering ~50 file types from the bundled Symbols Nerd Font Mono set: Rust, TS / JS / TSX / JSX, Python, Go, Java / Kotlin, Swift, C / C++ / C#, Ruby, PHP, Svelte, Vue, HTML, CSS / SCSS, JSON, YAML, TOML, XML, Markdown, txt / rst, shell scripts, SQL, images / video / audio, archives, lock files, env files, plus special-cased basenames (`Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `package.json`, `Dockerfile`, `Makefile`, `tsconfig.json`, `.gitignore`, `README*`, `LICENSE*`, `svelte.config.js`, `vite.config.*`).

A new sidebar **Editor** category in Settings hosts the full preference surface: ten toggleable CodeMirror extensions (autocomplete, close brackets, bracket matching, highlight active line, highlight selection matches, fold gutter, indent on input, line wrapping, rectangular selection, crosshair cursor) plus four behaviour fields (tab size, indent with tabs vs. spaces, respect-`.gitignore`-in-tree, large-file warning threshold). A second **Smart editing** section adds five further toggles for the heavier helpers — code snippets, keyword completion, JSON lint, inline color picker, and indent guides — all of them per-language, none of them require an LSP. Snippet packs cover the bread-and-butter patterns of Rust (`fn`, `impl`, `match`, `struct`, `enum`, `trait`, `derive`, `Result`, `Option`, `println!`, `dbg!`, …), TypeScript / JavaScript (`fn`, `arrow`, `class`, `interface`, `for`, `if`, `import`, `export`, `try`), Python (`def`, `class`, `for`, `if`, `try`, `with`), and Go (`func`, `if`, `for`, `struct`, `interface`, `package`, `defer`); keyword completion adds reserved-word suggestions for the same set plus C, C++, Java, and CSS. JSON lint hangs off `@codemirror/lint` with native `JSON.parse` round-trip plus curated rules for `package.json` (requires `name` + `version`), `tsconfig.json` (requires `compilerOptions` to be an object), and `.beardgit/requests/_env/*.json` (requires `vars` + `secrets`); no AJV. The color picker is `colorPicker` from `@replit/codemirror-css-color-picker`, the indent guides come from `@replit/codemirror-indentation-markers`, and the active-line gutter highlight piggybacks on the existing `highlight_active_line` pref via `highlightActiveLineGutter()` from `@codemirror/view`.

The autocomplete popup gets actual suggestions thanks to a global `completeAnyWord` source registered as a `languageData` entry; the language packs we ship for Rust / Python / Go / Java / etc. don't contribute completion data themselves, so without this the popup never opened on those buffers. HTML and CSS keep their built-in completion sources because language data merges instead of overriding.

The legacy-mode coverage of the editor's language pack picker grew via `@codemirror/legacy-modes`: TOML, Dockerfile, Makefile (recipe lines reuse the shell mode as the closest approximation), INI / Properties, Lua, Perl, R, and nginx configs all light up syntax highlighting now. `language-support.ts` does a basename-first lookup before the extension fallback, so `Dockerfile` / `Makefile` / `GNUmakefile` resolve correctly without a dotted suffix.

Backend (Rust): a new `crates/git-engine` workdir-CRUD module (`write_file_workdir`, `list_workdir_tree`, `create_workdir_path`, `rename_workdir_path`, `delete_workdir_path`) with a shared lexical path validator that refuses absolute paths, `..` segments, and anything that resolves outside the working tree. Reads cap at 2 MB (`read_workdir_file` returns a tagged `too_large` shape rather than slurping the bytes) and detect binaries with an 8 KB NUL sniff. All mutating commands run inside `with_mutation_guard(MutationKind::StagingChange)` so the watcher fan-out fires once on success and the Changes panel refreshes for free. `EditorPreferences` (in `crates/storage`) is the persisted struct backing all the toggles; existing `settings.json` files migrate transparently because every field uses `serde(default)`. The default sidebar nav order grows by one slot.

Per-project tab persistence: the open-tabs list (paths only, no buffer contents) is round-tripped through localStorage on project switch, so reopening the project this session — or after a restart — restores the same set. The `fileEditor` store subscribes to `project-mutated` so external file edits flag every non-dirty open tab as `externalChange: true`; the user reloads with the toolbar banner or clicks "Keep my version" to dismiss.

`PathTree` (the existing component shared with PR / MR diffs) gains an opt-in `showIcons` + `fileIconResolver` prop so the file-editor tree gets the rich Nerd-Font glyph treatment while the diff lists keep their compact look. Files / folders sort directories-first then alpha-by-name, and nested `<ul>`s reset their list-style so the browser's default disc bullets don't leak through into the rendered tree.

Sixty new i18n keys in en-US + es-ES (twenty-two settings, thirty-eight editor); paraglide bindings regenerated. New TS dependencies: `@codemirror/search@^6` (the find / replace panel + selection-matches highlight + search keymap), `@codemirror/legacy-modes@^6`, `@codemirror/lint@^6`, `@replit/codemirror-css-color-picker@^6`, `@replit/codemirror-indentation-markers@^6`. Plus a fresh wave of tests: 16 fileEditor store tests, 5 editorPrefs store tests, 9 wrapper / spec tests for the new IPC surface, 3 storage round-trip tests for `AppConfig.editor_preferences`, and 24 cases across `keywords.test.ts`, `snippets.test.ts`, `json-lint.test.ts`, and `file-icons.test.ts`.

### Discard unstaged changes per file

`feat(changes): discard unstaged changes per file`. The Changes panel's per-row context menu now has an explicit **Discard changes** entry next to the existing stage / unstage actions, alongside a confirmation dialog so a misclick can't blow away a long edit. Maps to `git checkout -- <path>` under the hood and routes through `with_mutation_guard` so the staging area refreshes the moment the workdir reverts. Previously the only way to drop unstaged work for a single file was the Clean panel or a terminal — neither of which was the obvious move on a dirty file row.

### Patches generated by BeardGit are now valid for users with a custom `diff.external`

`fix(cli,tests): pass --no-ext-diff to programmatic git diff + plug stale tests`. Users with a global `diff.external` configured (e.g. [`difftastic`](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/)) were silently producing non-applicable patch text from the "Create patch" command, malformed commit-stat numbers in the graph and on PR/MR pages, and AI prompts fed pretty-printed diff output instead of the canonical unified diff that the model actually expects. Every programmatic `git diff` shell-out now passes `--no-ext-diff` so the canonical unified diff is what comes back regardless of the user's config. Touches `git-engine::patch::create_working_tree_patch`, `git-engine::diff::commit_file_diff`, `git-engine::cli::commit_stats`, and `app_core::ai_commands::get_staged_diff_text`.

While there: three pre-existing tests on `beta` that were red on a freshly-cloned machine are now green. `requests_list_project` no longer materialises the `.beardgit/` directory chain on a project that hasn't opted into the Requests feature (the explicit seeding command remains the canonical path); `TabBar.svelte` defensively guards `$aiProviders.length` so a vitest e2e teardown race no longer surfaces an unhandled `TypeError`; the `BackgroundRunTranscript` copy test queries the rendered `<button>` instead of a `.btn-copy` class that never existed in the IconButton primitive.

## [0.1.11] — Requests panel + brand mark refresh — 2026-05-05

### Requests panel — `.http` API testing inside the repo

A new sidebar entry hosts a native HTTP request workspace that follows the same shareable-by-git philosophy as the rest of BeardGit. Project requests live under `<project>/.beardgit/requests/` as plain `.http` files (REST Client / IntelliJ HTTP Client format), so a `git pull` is enough for the whole team to share them; folders nest arbitrarily and the tree renders recursively. Environments live as sidecar JSON files under `_env/<name>.json` for non-sensitive variables, with secrets kept out of the repo and stored encrypted in BeardGit's local credential store via a new `requests-env://<env>/<name>` namespace on top of the existing `auth::CredentialStore`. The `default` env is always present — both `requests_list_project` and `requests_get_envs` lazily recreate `_env/default.json` when missing, and the env switcher dropdown has no "no env" option, so you can never end up working without one.

The editor pane uses CodeMirror 6 with the canonical `createCodemirrorTheme` so the body editor matches the rest of the app's code panes, JSON syntax highlighting, and `{{var}}` autocomplete that fires on the trailing `{{` and pulls suggestions from the active env's vars + secret names. The URL bar is a single-line CodeMirror micro-editor (`MiniCodeInput`) that gets the same autocomplete treatment, and autocomplete tooltips render with `position: fixed` against `document.body` so the popover never gets clipped behind the response tabs. The response viewer's Pretty mode is a read-only CodeMirror surface so you actually see syntax-highlighted JSON responses, not just a `<pre>` clone of Raw mode.

Send / Cancel is a real toggle backed by a `tokio_util::sync::CancellationToken` registered in `AppState.requests_cancellations` and addressed from a frontend-generated `crypto.randomUUID()` ticket id, so clicking Cancel actually aborts the in-flight `reqwest` future — not just the UI label. Run results persist into a new `requests-store` crate (its own SQLite file, `requests.db`, separate from the main app DB) with a 50-row history cap per request and a 5 MB body cap (truncated with a banner pointing at "Save raw to file…"). The response viewer's History tab reuses the existing CodeMirror merge view to diff any two responses by checkbox-selecting them. Includes Copy-as-cURL / fetch / HTTPie / wget code generators (rendered as a canonical dropdown menu matching `AddProjectMenu`'s look-and-feel), a Paste-from-cURL importer, right-click context menu on tree leaves (Copy as cURL, Duplicate, Rename inline, Open in editor via a backend `requests_open_in_editor` command that bypasses the `tauri-plugin-opener` allowlist, Delete with `ConfirmDialog`), and a "+ New request" affordance per section that surfaces in two places: the in-tree button and a primary-CTA in the empty-state seed prompt, both wired to a shared `newRequestOpen` writable so they open the exact same dialog.

A "Load test set" secondary action seeds nine `.http` examples against the public **JSONPlaceholder** (REST CRUD) and **httpbin.org** (request inspection, status codes, slow responses for testing Cancel) APIs, plus a default env wiring `base_url` / `httpbin_base_url` / `post_id`. Picking it lands you on `quickstart/jsonplaceholder/list-posts.http` ready to hit Send. The first save bumps `treeReloadSignal`, the watcher polls `.beardgit/requests/` for external mutations, and the env switcher refreshes off the same signal so seeded envs appear in the dropdown without a panel remount.

Visually the panel uses the shared design-system primitives end to end (`Button`, `IconButton`, `Field`, `Card`, `Dialog`, `List`, `TwoLineRow`, `ContextMenu`, `ConfirmDialog`); zero hardcoded colors, every accent goes through `var(--accent-*)` and `color-mix(...)` so the panel theme-tracks light/dark and any custom theme like the rest of the app. Method dropdown + URL field are normalised to the same height and the same `var(--font-mono)` so the row aligns cleanly. Verb badges (GET / POST / PUT / PATCH / DELETE) appear next to each leaf in the collections tree using the canonical tonal-on-accent recipe (`color-mix(--accent-blue 18%, transparent)` etc.).

EnvManager (opened via the **Manage** button next to the env switcher) lets you create / edit / delete envs, set encrypted secret values via a `SecretPrompt` modal, and shows a `(N vars, M secrets)` summary per env in the dropdown so you see at a glance whether an env has content. Save closes the dialog after a successful write, and Delete prompts a `ConfirmDialog` _before_ removing the file (was: deleted-then-asked).

### Brand mark refresh

`chore(icons): refine logo design` + `fix(welcome): sync welcome-screen logo with redesigned brand mark`. The app icon got a refresh and the welcome screen's hero glyph was re-pointed at the redesigned source asset so it stops drifting from the title-bar / tray icon set.

`fix(welcome): show BeardGit logo instead of generic icon glyph`. The welcome screen used to fall back to a generic icon when no project was open; now it surfaces the actual BeardGit brand mark, matching the rest of the empty-state messaging.

### Tab + welcome polish

`fix(tabs): clear repo state when closing the last tab`. Closing the only open project tab used to leave stale repo state in memory — the next "Open folder" could pick up the previous repo's HEAD or change-count for a brief flash. The tab close handler now wipes the active-project state when `projects.length` hits zero, so the welcome screen takes over cleanly.

### Landing site

`chore(docs/landing): add Metricool tracker`. The marketing/landing site under `docs/` now ships the standard Metricool analytics snippet, the same one the rest of metricool.com uses, so we can tell whether the landing actually drives sign-ups. No telemetry was added to the desktop app — `beardgit` itself remains telemetry-free.

## [0.1.10] — AI tasks in the drawer + persisted reviews, landing & community polish — 2026-04-28

### AI code review surfaces in the tasks drawer + persists to disk

`feat(ai): TaskKind::AiHeadless + save_ai_review`. Every headless AI command — Code Review, Generate commit message, Analyze, PR description, PR review — is now spawned with a new `TaskKind::AiHeadless` runtime variant and surfaced in the unified tasks drawer (statusbar Tasks slot + popover) alongside git ops and AI background runs. The tasks were previously spawned as `TaskKind::Generic`, which `TaskManager::should_emit` filters out, so they ran invisibly with output reachable only via the legacy detail panel. Adding `AiHeadless` to both `kind_from_runtime` and the `should_emit` allowlist makes the rows appear with the lightbulb glyph and a Cancel action while running.

`feat(ai): persist code review to <project>/.beardgit/reviews/`. When a Code Review task completes, the cleaned ANSI-stripped output is written to a new `<project>/.beardgit/reviews/review-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-<short-head>.md` file (a fresh `save_ai_review` Tauri command in `app-core::ai_commands`, backed by `git2::Repository::head` for the short oid). A 10-second success toast surfaces the relative path with an **Open** action that calls `openPath` (now allowed via `opener:allow-open-path` in capabilities) and falls back to `revealItemInDir` if the OS has no default markdown handler. The saved-file path is mirrored onto the task entry's subtitle via a new `setTaskSubtitle` helper backed by a `subtitleOverrides` map in `tasks.ts`, so the drawer's detail panel surfaces it under "Context" even after a late `task://update` upsert would otherwise have clobbered the field.

### Code review + Commit-message buttons gated on staged changes

`feat(staging): disable Code Review when nothing is staged`. The Code Review icon button in the Changes toolbar is disabled when `staged.length === 0` and its tooltip swaps to _"You need to stage changes to get a review"_. Same gate applies to the AI commit-message button. Both backends already analysed only the staged diff (`git diff --cached`), so the disabled state matches what the AI would actually see. Drops the dead `create_review_patch` Tauri command + `git_engine::create_review_patch` helper that briefly tried a HEAD-vs-worktree shape — staged-only is the right semantic.

### Tasks drawer polish

`fix(tasks): per-row Dismiss removes only that entry`. The Dismiss action on a single task row used to call `clearFinished()`, which wipes every finished task in the drawer — including ones the user wanted to keep. A new `removeTask(id)` helper trims a single entry, and the popover's `handleAction` routes per-row Dismiss through it. The header's "Clear" button still does the bulk wipe.

`fix(tasks): action-button clicks no longer also open the detail view`. Clicking Cancel / Dismiss / Retry on a row used to fire the action AND open the detail panel because the click bubbled up to the row's `onclick={openDetail}`. A `<div class="task-row__actions" onclick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}>` wrapper stops the bubble at the actions container; the action's own onclick still fires.

`fix(tasks): each_key_duplicate when output has blank lines`. The `{#each outputLines}` block in `TaskDetailPanel` keyed entries by `${stream}:${text}`, which collides on blank lines (`stdout:` × N) and made Svelte refuse to render the entire `<pre>` — empty detail panels for any AI review whose Markdown body had paragraph breaks. Switched the key to `${idx}:${stream}`.

`fix(tasks): Dismiss / Cancel buttons now have visible hover state`. Scoped CSS in `TaskEntryRow` lifts the neutral-button hover to `color-mix(--text-primary 12%, --bg-secondary)` inside `.task-row__actions` so the affordance reads cleanly in both themes.

`feat(tasks): bulb glyph for AI rows`. AI task rows in the drawer now use `` (fa-lightbulb-o), matching the AI commit-message button in the Changes toolbar.

### Diff: show whitespace toggle

`feat(settings): "Show whitespace in diffs" toggle`. New entry under **Settings → General → Diff display** that renders spaces as `·` and tabs as `→` in the side-by-side diff viewer (CodeMirror `highlightWhitespace` extension). Default off so unchanged diffs stay clean. Persists to `AppConfig::diff_show_whitespace` and re-renders any open `DiffEditor` instance immediately on toggle.

### Tauri Build workflow → manual-only

`ci(build): drop tag trigger, keep workflow_dispatch`. The Build workflow used to fire on every `v*` tag push, which duplicated the cross-platform Tauri build that the Release workflow already runs. `release.yml` covers the tag case fully (creates the draft release, uploads bundles, publishes); leaving `build.yml` triggered by tags burned six extra runners per release with no downstream consumer. The trigger is now `workflow_dispatch:` only — useful for "manually build the current branch and download the artifacts" without cutting a tag.

### README — AI and Observability sections rewritten

`docs: clearer AI background session description + local-only Observability`. The AI providers Highlights paragraph drops the irrelevant "show their version" claim and expands the background-session section with bullets that actually explain the user-facing surface — worktree under `.beardgit/ai-worktrees/<slug>`, dedicated `ai/<provider>/<slug>` branch, real-time streaming output that survives tab switches, FIFO + concurrency cap, final markdown report alongside the worktree, Resume / Focus actions. Observability is renamed _Observability — local-only_ and gains an explicit "nothing leaves your machine" paragraph (no telemetry / analytics / phone-home; the only outbound traffic the app initiates is the Tauri auto-updater poll) plus a per-platform log-path table. The Why bullet on credential storage is renamed _Secure and private by default_ and reinforces the no-telemetry posture at scan-level.

### Landing page — SEO/social meta, AVIF screenshots, Keyboard + FAQ sections

`feat(docs/landing): SEO/social meta, AVIF/WebP shots, keyboard + FAQ sections`. The marketing landing under `docs/` gains a real `<head>` — light/dark `theme-color`, canonical URL, full Open Graph + Twitter card with a 1200×630 `og:image`, a proper `svg` + 32px favicon + 180px apple-touch-icon set, and a JSON-LD `SoftwareApplication` block. Fraunces is pinned to `opsz=144,wght=500` and Fira Code to `wght@400;500` to cut first-paint cost. Every showcase `<img>` becomes a `<picture>` with AVIF → WebP → PNG fallback (hero keeps `fetchpriority=high`; the strip below it is `loading=lazy`). Total screenshot footprint drops from **8.6 MB PNG to ~497 KB AVIF**; the cold hero shot is now 86 KB instead of 1.3 MB. The placeholder-tag markup and CSS are removed now that real screenshots exist.

Two new sections: **04 Keyboard** lists 14 real shortcuts (Git / Graph / Tabs + UI) sourced from `src/lib/stores/shortcuts.ts` so the page can't drift from the app, and **06 FAQ** ships 7 collapsible items (unsigned builds, AI key storage, no-Electron, offline, other forges, license, bug reporting). The license FAQ wording makes explicit that BeardGit is free to use anywhere — the NC clause only blocks reselling BeardGit itself. Eyebrows renumber (Install 04→05, FAQ 06); both new sections are added to the top nav and the footer Product list. `app.js` now updates `<source srcset>` before `<img src>` on theme swap so the browser re-evaluates the `<picture>`, and `wireDownloads` fills a hidden hero badge with the version and relative release date when GitHub responds. Adds `docs/robots.txt` and `docs/sitemap.xml`.

### Community health — Code of Conduct, security policy, issue/PR templates

`chore(community): add CoC, security policy, issue/PR templates`. Sets up the GitHub community-health files. `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and `SECURITY.md` (latest stable release supported, `beta` best-effort, vulnerabilities reported via GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting). `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` ships structured forms for bug reports and feature requests plus a `config.yml` that disables blank issues and points support questions at Discussions. `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` nudges contributors to target `beta` (not `main`) and prompts for type-of-change checkboxes that match the conventional-commit prefixes the repo already uses.

### Internal

- `crates/cli-provider/src/auth.rs`: `mock_cli` switched from `fs::write` + `set_permissions` to `OpenOptions::new().mode(0o755)` + `sync_all` + `drop`, plus a `wait_for_exec_ready` probe loop that retries the script's exec on `ETXTBSY` for up to ~1.5 s before returning. Targets the intermittent _"Text file busy"_ failure on the GitHub Actions ubuntu runners. (Still flaky on `main` — tracked separately.)
- `crates/terminal/src/manager.rs`: `Session::last_fg_process` and its constructor assignment are gated behind `#[cfg(unix)]` to match the `master_fd` field, silencing the dead-code warning Windows builds were emitting.
- `crates/git-engine/src/patch.rs`: removed an unused `create_review_patch` helper that briefly backed a HEAD-vs-worktree review patch (replaced by direct `createWorkingTreePatch(true)` from the FE; staged-only is the correct semantic for review).

## [0.1.9] — Init repo on folder open + consolidated post-0.1.8 work — 2026-04-27

Bundles every change since `v0.1.8-beta` into a single cut. Drafts that were briefly headered as `0.1.10-beta` and `0.1.11-beta` while staged on `beta` are folded back in here — they never tagged or shipped under those numbers, so the version state package.json/tauri.conf bumps cleanly to `0.1.9`.

### Init repo on folder open

`feat(init-repo): InitRepoDialog + init_repo pipeline (gh/glab repo create)`. Picking a folder via **+ → Open folder…** that isn't already a git repository now opens an actionable dialog instead of failing with a generic toast. The dialog walks the folder via a new `count_folder_contents` Tauri command (respects any pre-existing `.gitignore` plus a built-in skiplist; capped at 50k files / 1 GiB) to preview how many files would be staged, then submits a single `init_repo` pipeline that runs `git init` with `main` as the initial HEAD, optionally drops a multipurpose `.gitignore` (covers macOS/Linux/Windows OS metadata, every common IDE/editor, and the Node/Rust/Python/Java/.NET/Go/Ruby/PHP/C++/Swift ecosystems), optionally stages and commits the existing files as **Initial commit**, optionally creates a matching repo on the active forge provider via `gh repo create` / `glab repo create`, wires it as `origin`, and pushes — all in one submit.

The primary action button auto-labels itself based on the ticked options (`Initialize` / `Initialize & create remote` / `Initialize & commit` / `Initialize, commit & push`). The provider dropdown only renders when more than one provider is connected; with zero providers the "Create remote" checkbox is disabled with a `Sign in to a provider in Settings` hint. The pipeline preserves partial progress on failure — a missed push, for example, leaves the local repo and origin remote intact so the user can retry from the toolbar without losing their work. Errors are step-tagged so the dialog can banner _which_ step failed (`Failed to create remote on GitHub: name already taken`) and which provider rejected the request.

Backend additions: `OpenProjectError::NotARepo` (so the FE can branch on the typed payload instead of substring-matching error strings), the `init_repo` and `count_folder_contents` Tauri commands, a new `ForgeProvider::create_repo` trait method with default `NotSupported`, GitHub and GitLab CLI adapters that map the modern flags (`--private`/`--public`, `--defaultBranch main`) and translate name-collision wording from both the REST and GraphQL surfaces (`already exists` / `already been taken`), and a `build_forge_provider_for_index` helper that lets `init_repo` resolve a provider before any project is open. Adds `i18n` keys in en-US + es-ES for every dialog label, primary-button variant, in-flight step strip, error banner, and the success toast.

### Init repo — use existing remote URL + tooltips on every element

`feat(init-repo): RemoteSpec::UseExisting wires a typed URL as origin`. The InitRepoDialog gains a second remote mode. Inside the renamed **Add remote repository** fieldset a radio chooses between _Create new on {provider}_ (the existing `gh repo create` / `glab repo create` flow) and _Use existing remote URL_ — a free-text field that wires whatever the user types as `origin` and pushes the initial commit, without going through any forge provider API. Lifts the original spec's "manually-typed remote URL" non-goal.

Side benefit: the dialog is now usable with **zero providers connected**. With no `gh`/`glab` configured, the _Create new_ radio is disabled with the existing `Sign in to a provider in Settings` hint and _Use existing_ auto-selects, so self-hosted git, Gitea, BitBucket, Codeberg, and internal corporate forges all work end-to-end from the same dialog. URL validation is intentionally loose — submit accepts any non-empty trimmed string, with a soft inline hint when the value doesn't look like an `https://` / `http://` / `ssh://` / `git@` / local-path URL. The push step is the authoritative validator; a typo / unreachable host / non-empty remote / missing credentials surfaces in the existing `Push` failure banner. Partial success is still preserved — a missed push leaves origin wired so the user can retry from the toolbar.

Two new pipeline labels (`Initialize & wire origin`, `Initialize, commit & push to existing remote`) cover the new combinations, bringing the primary-button label to a 6-state machine. A new success-toast variant (`Initialized {name} and pushed to the existing remote`) fires when the user-typed URL was pushed to.

`feat(init-repo): tooltips on every element`. Every interactive element in the dialog — the _Add remote_ checkbox, both mode radios, the provider dropdown, the name input, the visibility radios, the URL input, the _Commit existing files_ checkbox, and both action buttons — now carries a paraglide-driven `title=` tooltip. The primary button's tooltip is dynamic: it lists the exact pipeline steps that will run on click (e.g. `• git init on main` / `• Drop the multipurpose .gitignore` / `• Wire origin = https://…` / `• Push origin main`), updating live as the user toggles options. The dynamic step labels are localised in both en-US and es-ES.

Backend additions: a second `RemoteSpec::UseExisting { url, push_after }` variant; `run_init_pipeline` becomes a 3-arm match (`None` / `Create` / `UseExisting`); the Tauri wrapper's provider-resolution match is made exhaustive (no wildcard) so a future variant fails to compile here. The `UseExisting` arm trims whitespace, calls `git2::Repository::remote("origin", url)` and (optionally) `push_initial`; no provider lookup happens.

Frontend additions: TS `RemoteOption` discriminated union (`{kind:"create"} | {kind:"use_existing"}`); the `initRepo` payload mapper switches on `kind` and emits the matching snake_case wire shape. Dialog state grows `remoteMode` + `remoteUrl`; `$effect` defaults the mode based on provider count; `submit()` snapshots `path`/`name`/`mode`/`pushAfter` before `closeInitRepoDialog()` clears component state.

### Sidebar edit-menu fixes

### Fixed — drag-reorder of Navigation items did nothing

`fix(sidebar): enable HTML5 drag-drop by disabling Tauri native intercept`. Tauri 2 windows ship with `dragDropEnabled: true` by default — that intercepts pointer drag events at the window level for the native file-drop API and silently swallows the HTML5 `dragstart` / `dragover` / `drop` events the sidebar uses to reorder Navigation items. Set `dragDropEnabled: false` on the main window so the customize-layout drag-handle actually works. The keyboard fallback (focus the handle, ArrowUp / ArrowDown) was always functional but invisible to most users; both now work.

### Added — "Show more…" expander when items are hidden

`feat(sidebar): inline reveal for hidden navigation items`. The customize-layout panel lets the user hide Navigation items, but in normal mode there was no escape hatch — once hidden, an item could only be re-enabled by entering edit mode. A new `Show more…` row now appears below the visible list whenever any item is hidden, with a count badge of how many. Clicking it expands the hidden items inline (dimmed but clickable, so they're still navigable); clicking again collapses them. Local-only UI state — re-collapses on next mount.

### Fixed — customize-sidebar pencil button rendered a hover rectangle

`fix(sidebar): edit-toggle uses IconButton`. The "customize navigation" pencil in the sidebar's Navigation header had its own `.edit-toggle` style that drew a faint rectangular fill on hover, breaking the app-wide rule established in the IconButton refactor (icon-only buttons brighten the glyph, never draw a background). Migrated to the shared `IconButton` and dropped the dead CSS. Tooltip is the new `tooltip_customize_sidebar` paraglide key (en + es).

### Post-IconButton polish

### Fixed — `gh pr view` regression on `headRepositoryUrl`

`fix(mr-pr): use headRepository.url instead of headRepositoryUrl`. The recent PR diff view shipped with `headRepositoryUrl` in the `gh pr view --json …` field list, which `gh` does not expose — only `headRepository` (an object) is valid, and the URL lives on its `.url` sub-field. The Rust side now requests `headRepository` and walks the nested `url` via the existing path-walker, so opening any GitHub PR detail no longer fails with `CLI error: Unknown JSON field: "headRepositoryUrl"`. GitLab's `head_repo_url_path` was already correct (`["source_project", "http_url_to_repo"]`).

### Fixed — AI toolbar dropdown click-outside swallowed by xterm/CodeMirror

`fix(layout): close AI dropdown via capture-phase mousedown`. The dropdown's "click anywhere outside to close" handler ran in the bubble phase on `document`, so embedded surfaces that call `stopPropagation()` on mousedown (xterm.js terminal, CodeMirror editor) prevented it from ever firing. Switched to `{ capture: true }` so the handler always sees the click first.

### Fixed — AI dropdown tooltip described only one of its two actions

`fix(layout): clarify AI dropdown tooltip`. The trigger button labelled itself "Start AI background session on a worktree", which is only one of the two things in the menu — interactive provider terminals are the other. Updated the localized tooltip in en-US and es-ES to mention both.

### Fixed — `+` glyph and "↗ Graph" nav in the Branches view

`fix(branches): use canonical + glyph + wire show-in-graph nav`. The Branches header's "new branch" button rendered Nerd Font `U+E632` (a non-`+` glyph); replaced with `U+F067` (`nf-fa-plus`) to match every other "+" button in the app. Separately, clicking the `↗ Graph` button on a commit selected from the Branches view did nothing visible — `navigateToCommit` repositioned the graph viewport but the active view stayed on Branches. The handler now also calls `handleNavigate("graph")`, mirroring the working callsites on the graph and reflog views.

### Fixed — primary / danger / ghost button system: tonal-rest, solid-hover

`fix(ui): tonal-rest, solid-hover for shared Button variants`. The shared `Button.svelte` `primary` and `danger` variants used a fully-saturated accent at rest with `opacity: 0.9` on hover, which read as "highlighted at rest" and "dimmed on hover" — the inverse of the desired feedback. Worse, the local `.btn.primary` in `AiSessionDetail.svelte` was being silently overridden on hover by a cascading `.btn:hover` rule that turned the label `var(--accent-blue)` (matching the fill, hiding the text). All three variants now follow a consistent rule:

- **`primary`**: translucent accent-blue tint at rest (`color-mix(accent-blue 18%, transparent)`) with accent-blue text → solid `var(--accent-blue)` with `text-primary` on hover.
- **`danger`**: same pattern in red. Solid red at rest read as alarming for buttons (Disconnect, Clear cache, Delete asset) that don't fire instantly.
- **`ghost`**: dropped the `background: var(--overlay-hover)` rectangle on hover; only the text colour brightens, matching the `IconButton` rule.

The `AiSessionDetail` Resume / Focus buttons get the same pattern via local CSS overrides.

### Fixed — "Check for updates" raw error + missing diagnostics

`fix(settings): friendly error + diagnostics for update check`. Two changes that landed together:

- The Tauri updater plugin returns implementation-detail strings (`"could not fetch json"`, `"the network has temporary issue"`, etc.) verbatim. The Settings → Advanced → Check for updates row now maps recognisable "endpoint unreachable" shapes to a localized hint (`update_server_unreachable`) and only shows the raw text for unexpected failures.
- A new diagnostics block under the row exposes `Last checked: <relative time>`, `Endpoint: <url>` (the `latest.json` URL the plugin tries), and on error a monospace `Detail: <raw>` line. `UpdateState.lastCheckedAt` is set in the store on every terminal resolution. Useful for distinguishing "endpoint 404'd" from "DNS hiccup" without leaving the app.

Note: the underlying 404 (`releases/latest/download/latest.json` is missing because every release is currently flagged `prerelease=true` and GitHub's `/releases/latest/` redirect skips prereleases) is a release-pipeline concern, not addressed here.

### Icon-only buttons + brand logos

### Added — `IconButton` component + `Button.description` prop

`feat(ui): IconButton with native title tooltip; Button gains description`. New `src/lib/components/ui/IconButton.svelte` is the canonical primitive for buttons that show only a Nerd Font glyph (close ✕, refresh, new branch, etc.). It always renders a transparent background — only the glyph color brightens on hover, never a rectangular fill. `description` is required and drives both the native browser `title` (hover tooltip) and the `aria-label`, so an icon-only button is never silent to screen readers. New en-US/es-ES tooltip keys (`tooltip_close`, `tooltip_close_log`, `tooltip_remove`, `tooltip_new_branch`, `tooltip_refresh`) cover the migrated call sites.

`Button.svelte` gains a matching `description?: string` prop with the same semantics (sets `title`, falls back to `aria-label` when `ariaLabel` isn't provided).

### Changed — every icon-only button migrated, dead per-component CSS dropped

`refactor(ui): migrate 18 icon-only buttons to IconButton`. The grab-bag of `.btn-icon` (dialog.css), `.icon-btn` (list.css), `.refresh-btn` (list.css) and per-component `.header-btn` rules — each with its own slightly-different "fill on hover" — are gone. Migrated callsites: `BlameView`, `CommitDetail`, `ShortcutOverlay`, `BranchList` (new branch + refresh), `BisectWorkflow`, `PipelineView` (close log), `PipelineList`, `IssueList`, `MrPrList`, `TagList`, `AiSessionList`, `TriggerWorkflowDialog` (close + remove pair), `ReleaseDetail` (delete asset), `StagingDiffEditor` (close), and the shared `List.svelte` refresh button. Visible difference: hovering an icon-only button now brightens the glyph instead of drawing a rectangle around it.

### Changed — official brand logos for Codex / OpenCode

`feat(ai-sessions): theme-aware brand logos for codex + open_code`. The placeholder `codex.svg` (an outdated OpenAI mark with a hardcoded green fill) and `opencode.svg` (two arrow brackets) are replaced with the official assets:

- **Codex** — OpenAI monoblossom mark, shipped in black + white variants. `ProviderIcon` picks the right one off `$activeTheme.meta.mode` so the logo stays legible on both dark and light themes.
- **OpenCode** — official two-tone wordmark, shipped in light + dark variants and switched the same way.

`<img>` cannot resolve `currentColor` from the parent document, so a single asset per brand would either flatten the two-tone OpenCode mark or paint OpenAI's monoblossom in only one mode — hence the two-asset approach.

### Repo settings multi-instance fixes

### Fixed — auth probe scoped to the repo's host

`fix(repo-config): scope gh/glab auth status to the repo's host`. Opening repo settings on a `gitlab.com` (or `github.com`) repo no longer reports "authentication required" just because an _unrelated_ configured host (e.g. a self-hosted GitLab on a corporate VPN that happens to be unreachable) is failing. The CLI probe now passes `--hostname <host>`, where `<host>` is extracted from the repo's `origin` remote, so multi-instance `glab` / `gh` configs no longer poison each other. The frontend auth-required classifier was also tightened to match the structured `RepoConfigError::NotAuthenticated` Display prefix instead of any `auth` substring, so unrelated load failures no longer trigger the auth empty state.

### Fixed — `glab repo view` payload with both `topics` and `tag_list`

`fix(repo-config): drop tag_list serde alias on GlabRepoView.topics`. Modern GitLab emits both the canonical `topics` array and the deprecated `tag_list` array in the same `repo view -F json` payload. The previous `#[serde(alias = "tag_list")]` mapped both to the same struct field and serde rejected them as `duplicate field "topics"`, surfacing in the UI as "Failed to load — JSON parse error: duplicate field `topics`". The alias is removed; we read `topics` only.

### Theme color audit groundwork

### Theme — six new `--overlay-accent-*` tokens

`feat(theme): derive six --overlay-accent-* tokens in applyTheme`. The runtime theme now exposes `--overlay-accent-blue`, `--overlay-accent-red`, `--overlay-accent-green`, `--overlay-accent-orange`, `--overlay-accent-purple`, and `--overlay-accent-muted`, each derived at `applyTheme` time from the matching `ThemeData.derived` accent (or `text_secondary` for "muted") at 10 % alpha. Theme JSON files are unchanged — this is a pure runtime extension, ready to be consumed by the upcoming component color sweep.

### Brand allowlist

`feat(theme): add brand-colors.ts allowlist with snapshot test`. Log/provider brand colors (Anthropic, GitHub, GitLab, OpenAI, Codex, Gemini) now live in a single `src/lib/ui/brand-colors.ts` module. The component sweep will migrate every hardcoded brand hex onto these constants.

### Playwright visual baseline

`chore(test): install Playwright + visual baseline spec for top-level routes`. Added `tests/visual/routes.spec.ts` covering every top-level sidebar route in dark and light mode, so the upcoming component color sweep can diff against a known-good paint. The spec waits for `--overlay-accent-blue` to confirm `applyTheme` has run before snapping. Baseline screenshots will be captured on the first CI run where the full Tauri runtime is available (the Vite-only dev server lacks Tauri IPC, so `applyTheme` cannot fire locally).

### Lint — color literals blocked

`chore(lint): stylelint + custom eslint rule for color literals`. Stylelint's `color-no-hex` plus a small `eslint-plugin-beardgit/no-hex-in-svelte` rule now run in CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). Hardcoded colors are rejected everywhere except the four documented sources of truth: `src/lib/stores/theme.ts`, `src/lib/utils/status.ts` (pre-theme fallback map), `src/lib/ui/brand-colors.ts`, and `src/app.css` (root token defaults). Escape hatch for rare one-offs: a `// beardgit:allow-hex: <reason>` comment (or `<!-- beardgit:allow-hex: ... -->` in Svelte template markup) on or immediately above the offending line.

### PR diff view

### PR / MR diff view

`feat(mr-pr): per-file diff + inline review + prev/next nav`. Clicking any file in a PR or MR now opens a bottom resizable `DiffEditor` with the same CodeMirror merge view used by branches, stashes, tags, and the graph. Works for both GitHub and GitLab; fork PRs are supported via a new `ensure_commit_local` Tauri command that fetches the head commit on demand and streams progress to the tasks drawer. Inline review comments render as gutter bubbles with an on-click thread panel + composer, with GitLab `resolve`/`unresolve` toggles surfaced inline; posting a comment refreshes the PR detail so both the inline widget and the bottom comments section stay synced. Above 20 changed files the file list auto-switches to a collapsible path tree with per-folder aggregate add/del stats; under 20 it stays flat. `[` / `]` cycle through files with a visible "3 / 24" position indicator in the diff header. Binary files render a "Binary file — no preview" placeholder instead of the merge view.

### Data model

`feat(mr-pr): base_sha / head_sha / head_repo_url on MrPr`. Both the Rust and TS `MrPr` types gained these fields, populated from `gh pr view --json headRefOid,baseRefOid,headRepositoryUrl` and `glab mr view`'s `diff_refs` + `source_project.http_url_to_repo`. The new `ensureCommitLocal` IPC command uses them to fetch fork-PR heads before reading file content.

### Fix

`fix(mr-pr): include diff_refs in GitLab inline-comment position`. `add_mr_pr_inline_comment` on GitLab now sends the full `base_sha` / `head_sha` / `start_sha` trio in the `position` object, which the previous single-path implementation omitted — that shape is required for anything but trivial diffs.

### Branches UI feature-complete

### Branches — new-branch entry points + rename + force-push + shortcut

`feat(branches): unified create-branch dialog, rename, force-push, Cmd+Shift+B`. The Branches panel gains a visible "+" in its header that opens a new `CreateBranchDialog`, the single entry point used by every create-branch call site (header, context menu, graph, reflog, and the new global `⌘⇧B` / `Ctrl+Shift+B` shortcut). The dialog pre-fills the local name by stripping the matching remote prefix when branching from a remote ref, offers a "From" picker covering local and remote branches, and chains a `checkoutBranch` when "Check out new branch" is ticked (default on). Two previously WIP context-menu items are live: "New branch from here" opens the dialog with the clicked ref as the source; "Push" fires directly to the single configured remote or expands to a submenu when multiple remotes exist. Branch rename ships as a new dialog + `rename_branch` Tauri command; renaming the checked-out branch updates HEAD automatically and the panel's selection follows the new name. Force-push gets its own submenu that always requires a destructive confirm — even for single-remote repos — and passes `--force-with-lease` to `git push` along with `-u` so first-time pushes establish the upstream tracking ref. The `graph_branch_name_prompt` `window.prompt()` calls in the graph and reflog are retired.

### Sidebar customization

### Sidebar — reorder and hide Navigation items

`feat(sidebar): user-customisable Navigation order + hide toggles`. The Navigation section of the sidebar now has an explicit edit mode — click the pencil in the `NAVIGATION` label to enter. In edit mode each row gets a drag handle, an eye toggle, and the section header gains `Reset` + `Done` buttons. Drag-and-drop reorders items (keyboard: `ArrowUp`/`ArrowDown` on the drag handle); the eye toggles individual items between visible and hidden with a guardrail preventing the user from hiding every last section. Layout is persisted app-wide (not per-repo) via two new `AppConfig` fields (`sidebar_nav_order`, `sidebar_nav_hidden`) and debounced by 250 ms. When a future release ships a new nav item, it appears automatically at the end of the saved order.

The Provider section (GitHub / GitLab) is no longer user-managed — it auto-hides when no provider is connected, and if the user was viewing a provider-scoped route (`pipelines`, `issues`, `merge-requests`, `releases`, `repo-config`) at disconnect time, the app reroutes them back to the Graph.

### AI sessions list trim

### AI sessions — one-line rows, detail-pane actions

`feat(ai-sessions): trim list rows to icon + title + date`. The Active terminals and Conversations sections in the AI Sessions view now render one line per row: provider icon, title, relative date. Everything else — provider name, cwd, forked-from badge, bg-run status badge, Resume / Focus buttons — moves to the detail pane. Tab and segment rows, which previously had no detail branch, gain one: selecting them surfaces the provider, title, cwd, and a Focus button so keyboard users can reach the action without chasing a hover affordance. Three selection stores (`selectedConversationId`, `selectedBackgroundSessionId`, `selectedActiveTerminal`) now coordinate through a shared `selectAiSessionRow` helper so at most one row is selected at any time.

### Toolbar — AI dropdown, plain terminal button

- `refactor(toolbar): AI becomes a dropdown, terminal becomes a plain button`. The toolbar's terminal split-button is now a single button (its old dropdown only surfaced the project-root fallback that the button itself already does). The "AI" / "IA" button is now an always-dropdown listing every installed AI CLI provider plus a "Launch session in background…" entry, which is where the per-provider launchers used to live under the terminal chevron. Escape / outside-click close the menu; aria-haspopup / aria-expanded / role=menu land for screen-reader parity.

### Pipelines + Issues lists v2 (was drafted as 0.1.11-beta)

### Wider list pane, shared row primitive, richer meta

`feat(lists): widen pipeline + issues pane to 420px and share TwoLineRow`. The Pipelines and Issues side panes now open at 420 px so seeded data stops ellipsing past the first glance. Rows in both lists render through a new shared `TwoLineRow` primitive (`src/lib/components/common/TwoLineRow.svelte`), so future layout tweaks land in one file instead of drifting between the two views. `PipelineList` migrated off its bespoke container onto the shared `List` component — header, search, empty state, load-more, and the polling bar are now the List's responsibility.

Issues rows drop the 3-label cap (every label shows, wrapping onto line 2 naturally), surface the milestone as a chip, and render up to three assignees as an `AssigneeStack` with `+N` overflow. Pipeline rows gain the triggering actor (`triggering_actor.login` on GitHub, `user.username` on GitLab) and move the duration onto the meta line so the trailing-date slot only holds the relative timestamp.

New i18n keys: `issues_milestone_icon_aria`, `issues_assignees_aria`, `pipeline_actor_aria` (en-US + es-ES).

### Repo settings in the sidebar (was drafted as 0.1.10-beta)

### Repo settings — sidebar view replaces the modal

`feat(repo-config): move repo settings to a provider-scoped sidebar view`. The per-repo "Repo settings" UI is no longer a modal dialog launched from a cog on the project tab. It's a first-class sidebar entry inside the GitHub / GitLab section, with a master/detail layout (section list on the left, option rows on the right), hash deep-links (`#repo-config/<section>`), per-section Save/Discard, and a navigation guard that catches every way of leaving a dirty section — sidebar click, section switch, project switch. Sections render instantly; each one loads its data in the background on first open via a shared loader with an in-flight dedupe + ~30 s TTL cache. The cog button and the right-click "Repo settings" context menu on the project tab are gone — the sidebar is the only entry point.

### Auto-update, viewport-windowed graph, lean statusbar, landing page, quick wins, reactivity foundation, AI sessions UX, forge data fixes, settings IA polish, log rename, E2E retirement, AI sessions transcript-first rewrite (originally drafted as the first 0.1.9 cut)

Two distinct waves of work since `v0.1.8-beta`. Wave one (2026-04-20) landed the in-app auto-updater, viewport-windowed commit walking, the lean statusbar + unified tasks drawer, a persistent graph layout cache, the GitHub Pages landing page, and the "Quick Wins" refactor bundle. Wave two (2026-04-21 / 2026-04-22) shipped seven sequential specs — each on its own feature branch with a dedicated design + plan doc — culminating in the AI sessions transcript-first rewrite.

### In-app auto-update

`feat(update): in-app auto-update with re-auth notice`. The app now self-updates from the tauri-updater feed without sending the user back to the download page. When the update lands on a build that needs a re-auth (token schema bump, new scope), the updater surfaces a one-time notice so users don't hit a silent failure on first post-update connect.

### Graph — viewport-windowed commit walking (MT-1)

`feat(MT-1): viewport-windowed commit walking (#4)`. The graph builder no longer materializes the entire history on cold start. The walker pages the commit list against the viewport window and extends as the user scrolls, so repos with 100k+ commits paint in milliseconds instead of seconds. Pair this with the Spec-1 `GraphViewportCache` slice and cold-start paint is now synchronous from persisted state.

### Lean statusbar + unified tasks drawer

`feat(ui): lean statusbar + unified tasks drawer`. The statusbar is compacted to the essentials — branch, provider, tasks indicator, AI slot — with everything else collapsing into dropdowns. The old tasks footer and the floating task toasts are unified into a single tasks drawer that slides up from the statusbar; it doubles as the "See details" target for sticky failure toasts.

Follow-up fixes in the same slice: `fix: statusbar tasks + ai-slot navigation + post-commit graph refresh` restored navigation when clicking a task row; `fix(tasks): restore popover UX + spinning state-coloured icon` brought back the running-state animation that the migration had dropped; `fix(tabbar): AI background button renders play + branch glyph` and `fix(tabbar): AI background button shows bold AI/IA text label` finished the tab-bar entry point for background runs.

### Persistent graph layout cache

`feat: persistent graph layout cache`. Graph lane assignments and row positions are now persisted per-repo so the second-and-subsequent open of a project hits warm layout state. This is the storage half of the Spec-1 cache-first paint path.

### Repo config — configure remote repo via gh/glab CLI

`feat(repo-config): configure remote repo via gh/glab CLI`. The "Configure remote" flow now delegates to `gh repo edit` / `glab repo update` for supported fields (description, homepage, topics, default branch) instead of inventing a bespoke REST surface. Keeps the provider abstraction thin and picks up any field support upstream adds for free.

### AI — Codex + OpenCode provider parity

`feat(ai): Codex + OpenCode provider parity`. Fills the remaining gaps between the three providers so the sessions / background / settings surfaces behave identically across Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode. Session detection, argv builders, config-file paths, and brand wiring all line up — no more per-provider "coming soon" states in the UI.

### Landing page (docs/)

`site(landing): add GitHub Pages landing page under docs/`. BeardGit now has a public landing page served from `docs/` on GitHub Pages.

- `site(landing): wire real screenshots with theme-aware swap and lightbox` — replaces the placeholder art with actual app screenshots; each shot has dark + light variants that swap based on the visitor's `prefers-color-scheme`, and clicking opens a lightbox.
- `fix(landing): responsive breakpoints for mobile + tablet` — layout no longer breaks under 768 px.

### Forge — pre-releases + closed PRs on GitHub

`fix(forge): surface pre-releases + closed PRs on GitHub`. The GitHub list queries were filtering out prereleases and closed PRs by default; both now appear in the respective views alongside stable releases and open PRs.

### AI sessions polish (pre-Wave A)

`fix(ai): session list polish, resume-in-terminal, and dialog alignment`. Pre-spec round of fixes on the AI Sessions view — row alignment, dialog chrome consistency, and the resume-in-terminal action wiring — preceding the Spec-2 UX pass further down.

### Quick Wins bundle

Seven disjoint-file branches merged sequentially into `feat/quick-wins`, then into `beta`. No single slice warrants a full section but together they tighten the component story meaningfully.

- **Shared empty-state partial** — `feat(frontend): shared empty-state partial + descriptions for issues/pipelines/releases`. Empty states across Issues, Pipelines, and Releases now render from one primitive with per-view descriptive copy, instead of three near-duplicate empty blocks.
- **Picker consolidation** — `refactor(mr-pr): migrate MrPrDetail to common/LabelPicker`, `chore(mr-pr): drop duplicate LabelPicker component`, `refactor(issues): adopt shared dialog chrome in AssigneePicker`, `refactor(mr-pr): adopt shared dialog chrome in ReviewerPicker`. The MR-PR view stops shipping its own `LabelPicker` copy; AssigneePicker and ReviewerPicker drop their hand-rolled dialog styles in favour of the shared chrome.
- **`.btn-icon` refactor** — nerd-font glyph-only buttons across `ShortcutOverlay`, `CommitDetail`, `BlameView`, `StagingDiffEditor`, `TriggerWorkflowDialog`, `PipelineView`, `TaskPopover`, `TaskPanel`, and the dialog close buttons in `RebaseEditor` / `CreateReleaseDialog` / `CreateIssueDialog` / `TriggerWorkflowDialog` now share one `.btn-icon` class on `dialog.css`. `refactor(frontend): resolve .btn-icon naming collisions` cleans up the one place two different components had collided on the name.
- **Graph refresh on branch-from-context-menu** — `fix(graph): reload graph after creating a branch from context menu`. The graph didn't pick up branches created from the context menu until the next manual refresh; it now reacts immediately.
- **Console-noise cleanup** — `fix(frontend): route theme/branch errors through toast, drop console noise`. Theme-load and branch-switch failures used to log to the console and vanish; they now surface in the toast system where the user actually sees them.
- **E2E on feature branches** — `ci: run E2E suite on all branches, not just main/beta`. Catches regressions before the `beta` merge, not after. (Later disabled temporarily while the 2026-04-21 spec set lands, then removed entirely with the Spec-6 E2E retirement below.)

### Tests — app-core command coverage

`test(app-core): unit tests for all command modules`. The 24 command modules split out of the old monolithic `commands.rs` in v0.1.8 now have unit test coverage across the board, not just the three or four hot paths.

---

### Wave two — the 2026-04-21 / 2026-04-22 spec cycle

Seven sequential specs brainstormed and shipped across two days. Each spec merged into `beta` on its own feature branch with a dedicated design + plan document.

### AI sessions — transcript-first rewrite (Spec 7, 2026-04-22)

The AI Sessions view no longer treats `~/.claude/sessions/{pid}.json` as the source of truth. Each provider now reads its own on-disk transcript store and surfaces conversations as first-class rows; terminal tabs BeardGit actually owns are a separate "Active" list that supports real focus. Root cause ticket: [claude-code#12235](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/12235) — every Claude `--resume` spawns a fresh process with a new UUID; attaching to a running CLI was never possible, so the old "Focus external" button was always a lie.

- **New `AiConversation` type** (Rust `ai_provider::AiConversation`, TS mirror) — id, provider, cwd, created/last_activity unix-ms timestamps, title, optional `parent_id` 8-char prefix when the transcript was forked.
- **New `AiProvider::list_conversations` trait method**. `list_sessions` and `is_session_active` deleted from the trait; `AiSession` the type stays (background runs still use it).
- **Claude Code** reads `~/.claude/projects/{cwd-slug}/*.jsonl`. Title walks for the first non-meta `type: "user"` record with extractable text (supports both string content and `{type, text}` arrays; skips `<command-name>` / `<local-command-caveat>` envelopes). Fork detection from the first record's `parentUuid`.
- **Codex** walks `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl`, parses the first-line `session_meta` payload for id/cwd/timestamp. Title is MVP-empty (follow-up extracts the first user prompt from later lines).
- **OpenCode** shells out to `opencode session list --format json` and maps `directory → cwd`, `updated → last_activity_at`, `title` verbatim.
- **Two new Tauri commands** — `ai_list_conversations` and `ai_resume_conversation`. The old `ai_list_sessions` / `ai_resume_session` / `aiListSessions` / `aiResumeSession` are deleted.
- **Two-section UI** — `AiSessionList.svelte` renders Active (BeardGit-owned terminal tabs + segments + running/queued bg-runs) above Conversations (on-disk transcripts for the current repo). Mutually-exclusive selection between conversation and bg-run in the detail pane. Row action for Conversations is labelled "Resume in new terminal" with a tooltip naming the forking semantics explicitly.
- **Dropped** the `~/.claude/sessions/{pid}.json` scanner, `is_claude_process`, `process_alive`, `is_file_active`, `AiSessionWatcher` pointing at the dead PID dir (repointed to `~/.claude/projects/` + `~/.codex/sessions/`).
- **i18n** — 10 new `ai_sessions_*` keys in en-US + es-ES (peninsular tuteo). `ConversationRow` is keyboard-reachable (`role="button"` + Enter/Space).
- **Testing**: Rust workspace 1 045 tests (−31 for deleted legacy tests), Vitest 653 tests across 91 files (−25 for deleted stores), clippy clean, svelte-check 0/0.

### Reactivity & feedback foundation (Spec 1)

Every repository mutation — UI-initiated, AI-initiated, or external CLI — now broadcasts a precise `project-mutated` event so the UI converges on fresh state without per-call-site refresh code.

- **New `mutation-events` Rust crate** — `Snapshot::capture` + `diff`, `MutationGuard` RAII wrapper, `MutationKind` enum (commit / push / stash / worktree / staging_change / ai / external / …), `MutationFlags` struct, `emit_mutation` helper. Status fingerprint tracks per-file index/worktree bitflags so staging transitions flip `status_changed` even when the overall dirty boolean doesn't move.
- **app-core commands wrapped** — every mutating Tauri command (commit / amend / branch / tag / stash / staging / worktree / remote / cherry-pick / revert / rebase / reset / merge / conflict / clean / patch / submodule / mr_pr / releases) fires the guard on success.
- **watcher crate** — debounced `.git/**` change → `MutationKind::External` so CLI edits outside BeardGit still refresh the UI.
- **AI background runs** — coordinator captures pre/post worktree snapshots and emits `MutationKind::Ai { source }` on completion / failure / cancellation.
- **TS `mutations.ts` store** — single `project-mutated` listener coalesces events per rAF tick, buffers flags per project path, flushes on tab switch, dispatches the minimal refresh set to `graph` / `changes` / `stashes` / `worktrees` / `repoConfig`.
- **`runMutation` wrapper** — caller-side toast + task-record seam. Silent-set (stage / unstage / discard) suppresses success toast. Failures are sticky with a **See details** action that opens the Tasks popover at the failing task's detail panel.
- **Graph cache-first paint** — per-project `GraphViewportCache` slice persisted in `project-cache.ts`; synchronous hydration on cold start; faint skeleton stripes while first paint resolves; HEAD-OID reconciliation preserves scroll anchor when new commits land above the cached top.
- **Statusbar provider filter** — new `projectProvider` derived store. `repoConfig` wins; otherwise inferred from `origin` URL (`github.com`, `gitlab.*`). Renders 0 or 1 pill, never both.
- **Tasks popover regression fixed** — click-bubble race where the opening click hit the outside-click handler on the same frame. Rising-edge `ready` latch tied to the `open` transition.

### AI sessions UX pass (Spec 2)

The AI Sessions tab is now async-first, populates detail on click, supports open-in-terminal via the shared runMutation seam, and renders brand logos at native transparency.

- **`ProviderIcon` shared component** + brand SVG assets for Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and a generic fallback. No enclosing background square — brand logos render at native transparency.
- **`AiSessionList`** — shell paints immediately, refresh fires fire-and-forget in `onMount`. Row layout: 8 px padding, vertically-centered 20 px icon slot, External badge when `worktree_path` is missing or unreachable.
- **`AiSessionDetail`** — populates on `selectedBackgroundSessionId` change. Header uses `ProviderIcon`. Open-in-terminal / Cancel / Discard routed through `runMutation` with sticky-failure toasts.
- **AI Settings, TabBar, AiSlot, TaskEntryRow** — migrated to the shared `ProviderIcon`; generic nerd-font glyphs retired.
- **i18n** — en-US + es-ES keys for the new toast labels.

### Forge data fixes (Spec 3)

PR and Release detail panes no longer hang; error and empty states are distinct and localized.

- **`ForgeDetailShell`** — shared loading / error / empty / content state primitive used by both `MrPrDetail` and `ReleaseDetail`.
- **`withTimeout`** helper + `TimeoutError` — 15 s bound on detail fetches; errors surface via a new per-detail error store (`mrPrDetailError` / `releaseDetailError`) + sticky toast with a **Retry** action.
- **PR #18 infinite loading** — root cause traced to unbounded `gh api --paginate` for ~3 400-file diffs. Fix: 50 MB payload cap + 20 s subprocess timeout in `cli-provider` via `wait-timeout`. Frontend's 15 s `withTimeout` is the outer guard.
- **Release-blank** — `#[serde(default)]` didn't accept explicit JSON `null`. New `null_as_default` deserializer handles null `body` / `assets` from `gh`/`glab` payloads.
- **Empty-state copy** — "No changes in this pull request." / "No release notes or assets published for {tag}."

### Settings IA polish (Spec 4)

One canonical shape for the settings navigation, driven by the shared primitives from Spec 2.

- **`LookAndFeelSection.svelte`** extracted from `GeneralSettings`. General now owns a single Look & Feel card (no duplicate blocks).
- **Appearance tab removed** — collapsed into General; legacy `appearance` deep-links redirect to `general`.
- **Editor/Diff tab removed** — the placeholder page wasn't implemented; legacy `editor` deep-links redirect to `general`.
- **`CATEGORY_IDS`** reduced to `general / git / ai / integrations / advanced`.
- **AI Settings** — stray broken-glyph refresh button deleted; provider icons verified wired to `ProviderIcon`.
- **`ConnectionHowTo`** — reworked as a compact top-level dropdown (OAuth / PAT / CLI modes) rendered above the card, not inside.
- **Integrations Connections** — unified single Card with a new `ConnectionRow` primitive dispatching on `kind` (github / gitlab / gh / glab). `CliAuthSection.svelte` and `ProviderSetup.svelte` deleted.

### Log filename convention (Spec 5)

Log files now write as `beardgit.{date}.log` (was `beardgit.log.{date}`) so `*.log` globs match them and log-rotation tooling sees the date as the disambiguator, not the extension. Rotation cleanup tolerates both shapes so legacy files age out under the existing retention policy.

### E2E infrastructure retired

The WebdriverIO + tauri-driver suite is removed while the app is in heavy flux. Specs would need continuous rewriting against a moving target; the Vitest integration layer under `src/test/e2e/` remains as the sustainable cross-store regression suite. Re-introduction happens once the UI stabilises and a focused "write E2E from scratch" spec is brainstormed.

- Deleted `e2e/` directory (specs, fixtures, page objects, Dockerfile, run scripts).
- Dropped the `e2e-tests` job from `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- Removed `@wdio/*` devDependencies + the `npm run e2e*` scripts from `package.json`.
- Dropped the `window.__E2E__` surface + `VITE_BEARDGIT_E2E` gate from `src/routes/+layout.svelte`.

### Auth & Integrations

- Connecting a forge PAT now also logs the matching `gh`/`glab` CLI in automatically via a fire-and-forget background task; disconnecting logs it out. Users get both API and CLI auth in one action, under the same identity.
- `ConnectionHowTo` PAT guidance rewritten: defaults to the PAT mode, explicit warning against fine-grained tokens (they break `gh`/`glab` via missing GraphQL support — see cli/cli#6680), SSO callout for GitHub orgs, and a collapsed "manual login command" reference block with `<YOUR_PAT>` placeholders and a no-history `read -rs` variant.
- CLI row in the Connections card now labels itself **"Connected · via {Provider} PAT"** when its authenticated username matches a connected forge provider — surfacing that both halves share one identity.
- Removed orphan programmatic OAuth device-code flow (`cli_login` Tauri command, `start_cli_login`, `OAuthLoginProcess`, `OAuthLoginInfo`, `oauth-device-code` event emit). Superseded by the terminal-hosted `gh auth login` flow shipped with xterm.js in v0.1.5 and the new PAT-pipe flow above.

### Wave A polish — buttons, markdown, AI sessions

Three disjoint-file slices shipped in parallel worktrees, merged sequentially to `beta`.

- **Button primitive.** `ui/Button` gains a `subtle` variant (theme-token tonal fill + accent-blue hover border) that sits between `primary` and `ghost` for actions that need to read as actionable without going loud. `secondary`'s baseline moved from `--overlay-hover` (a hover state, never a fill) to `--bg-secondary` — fixes the task-row action buttons rendering as near-white on the default dark theme. `ConnectionRow.svelte` fully migrated: every button routes through the primitive, 39 lines of shadowed local `.btn-*` CSS gone. Manage button no longer reads as disabled.
- **Markdown renderer.** Release / Issue / MR-PR detail bodies now render full GitHub-flavored markdown (fenced code blocks, tables, task lists, autolinks, strikethrough) via `marked`. Replaces the minimal `snarkdown` renderer that dropped or garbled those elements. Sanitiser extended to allow `<input type="checkbox">` for task lists and to rewrite `href="javascript:…"` to `href="#"`. Scoped `.body` styles added per detail component using theme tokens.
- **AI Sessions interactions.** Fixed four bugs that made the view feel broken: clicking an external (provider-reported) session now populates the detail pane (was always empty — the derived selection only looked in the background-run map); the detail pane gains real Focus / Open-Terminal / Dismiss actions instead of a placeholder "external terminal" label; the Focus button on a composite-tab-hosted terminal now sets both `activeTabIndex` and the composite's `activeSegmentIndex` so the user actually sees the terminal; the merged-sessions list dedupes by `(provider, cwd)` for active-interactive rows so a single Claude process doesn't show as two entries with different IDs. Tier/focus/resume logic extracted to a shared `aiSessionActions.ts` so list and detail share one implementation.

### Testing

- **Rust:** 1 034 tests across the workspace, clippy clean on `--workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`.
- **Frontend:** 639 Vitest tests across 90 files.
- **svelte-check:** 0 errors / 0 warnings across 2 989 files.

## [0.1.8] — Phases 6–10: Bisect, CLI Auth, AI Stack, Forge Integration, Bundled CLIs, Refactor, E2E, Performance

The biggest release since the MVP — everything since `v0.1.7-beta` ships in one cut. Five phases of feature work plus a deep architecture and performance pass: visual bisect, CLI auth, the full AI stack (three providers, headless background runs in worktrees), GitLab + GitHub forge integration with bundled CLIs, the provider architecture cleanup, and the E2E + tracing infrastructure.

### AI Background Worktree Runs (Phase 10)

Launch a headless AI coding run inside a fresh git worktree without opening a terminal. Three entry points: tab bar button, AI Sessions header, and `Cmd+Shift+A`. Prompt source: free text, saved prompt from `.claude/prompts/`, or skill from `.claude/skills/` (user or project scope). Provider: Claude Code, Codex, or OpenCode. Worktree root configurable (default `.beardgit/ai-worktrees`); concurrency cap configurable (default 3) with FIFO queueing past the cap.

- **`ai-provider`** — `AiBackgroundRunInput` + `AiBackgroundRunStatus` + `AiTokenUsage` types; `launch_background` trait method with `NotSupported` default; `MockProvider` override for tests.
- **`claude-code` / `codex` / `opencode`** — headless command builders with provider-specific flags (Claude: `--print --output-format stream-json --verbose`; Codex/OpenCode: prompt concatenation fallback where skill/prompt flags aren't native).
- **`task-runner`** — `TaskKind::AiBackground` variant + `spawn_with_options` with stdin piping (backwards compatible — `spawn()` unchanged).
- **`app-core`** — `AiBackgroundCoordinator` with full lifecycle (Queued → Running → Completed / Failed / Cancelled), concurrency cap enforcement, worktree creation via `git-engine` and cleanup on discard. 6 Tauri commands + 2 settings commands.
- **`git-engine`** — `create_worktree_at` helper used by the coordinator.
- **`storage`** — `AppConfig` gains `ai_worktree_root`, `ai_background_concurrency_cap`, `ai_prompt_auto_accept` fields with serde defaults.
- **Frontend** — `CreateBackgroundRunDialog` with Free / Saved / Skill tabs, `BackgroundRunStatusBadge`, `BackgroundRunTranscript` with ANSI stripping, session detail + list integration, settings card, ~50 i18n keys per locale. `aiBackground.ts` store wires `ai-background-output` / `ai-background-status` events via `requestAnimationFrame` batching (matches the `tasks.ts` pattern); merges live runs into `aiSessions` for unified sidebar display.
- **Testing** — 13 tests in `app-core::ai_background` (coordinator lifecycle + cap + cancel + discard), 5 in `ai-provider`, 3 per provider for argv builders, 7 vitest tests for the store.

Known follow-ups for a later release: "View changes" button (deferred — merge-editor expects a conflict state, current release ships "Switch to worktree tab" as the review path), toast notification event wiring (i18n keys present), and an end-to-end spec exercising the full dialog (placeholder at `e2e/specs/regression/ai-background.spec.ts`).

### Beta Audit — Performance & Code Quality

A bundled audit pass landing 15 fixes from the beta-audit spec — the highest-leverage cleanup before tagging the release.

**Performance (high impact)**

- Cache `which::which()` results per provider kind on `AppState` — repeated provider detection no longer hits the filesystem.
- Replace task polling loops with `TaskManager::wait_for_terminal` backed by `tokio::sync::Notify` — no more spin-wait on long-running tasks.
- Memoise `Arc<dyn ForgeProvider>` keyed on `(provider_index, project_path)` — repeated forge lookups skip the construction cost.

**Correctness**

- Populate the GitLab label cache so issue labels render with their real colour.
- Unify `MrPr.labels` with `Issue.labels` on `Vec<Label>`; `PillRow` now renders the real label colour everywhere.
- Drop redundant `refreshIssueList` calls on label / assignee / milestone mutations — the optimistic update already covers it.
- Route `resolve_startup_theme` through `src/lib/api/tauri.ts` for consistency with every other IPC call.
- Key `#each` blocks over MR/PR diff files + comment lists for stable Svelte reconciliation.

**Code quality**

- Extend the trait-crate purity CI guard to include `ai-provider` (alongside `provider` and `forge-provider`).
- Share `build_gh_upload_args` / `build_glab_upload_args` across crates instead of duplicating the argv shape.
- Add `TaskManager::get_status` and a frontend `taskById` derived map for O(1) status lookup.
- Move `shell_escape` into `helpers.rs` with unit tests.
- Rename `MrPrComment` to `ForgeComment` in TypeScript (deprecated alias kept for one release).
- Extend `MrPrFilter` with author / label / text fields, matching `IssueFilter`.
- Rename the `render:text` perf measure to `render:badges-and-text` to match what it actually measures.

### GitLab Provider Polish

- **Per-file +/- counts** — `projects/:id/merge_requests/{n}/diffs` returns the raw patch but no additions/deletions counts. We were hardcoding 0/0, which showed as "+0 -0" beside every file in the MR detail panel. New `count_patch_changes` parser counts `+` / `-` content lines while skipping `+++` / `---` file headers and `@@` hunk headers. 4 unit tests.
- **`glab mr list` boolean state flags** — glab (both 1.46.1 and 1.92.1) does not accept `--state <value>`; passing `--state opened` made glab reply "Unknown flag" and our list returned empty. Switched to the boolean form glab actually supports: default → opened, `--closed`, `--merged`, `--all`. Dropped the unused `state_to_glab_str` helper.
- **Provider-aware sidebar label** — sidebar "Merge Requests" now reads "Pull Requests" when the active provider is GitHub. View id stays `merge-requests` so routing is unchanged; only the label swaps. New `sidebar_pull_requests` i18n key.
- **MR/PR list errors are surfaced** — `refreshMrPrList()` no longer swallows failures. Errors go to a new `mrPrListError` store and `MrPrList` renders them inline with a Retry button instead of an empty list with no explanation.

### Settings — Connection Guide

- **"How to connect" guide** — collapsible help block in Settings → Connection covering standard gitlab.com / github.com setup (PAT + CLI flows), self-hosted GitLab with OAuth and token fallback, plus troubleshooting for the multi-config warning and the 404-when-self-hosted-points-at-gitlab.com trap.

### Distribution

- **macOS x64 dropped from the release matrix** — Apple Silicon runners are now the only macOS target. Reduces CI matrix time and avoids the dual-bundle confusion at install time.
- **Bundle formats trimmed** — `.msi`, `.deb`, and `.rpm` removed from the bundle list. The `.dmg`, `.AppImage`, and `.exe` remain as the supported install paths per platform.
- **First-launch documentation** — README now explains the unsigned-build workaround for macOS until code signing lands (Gatekeeper right-click → Open). E2E fixture path no longer pins to a hardcoded location; derived from the working directory at runtime so contributors can run the suite from anywhere.
- **Repository hygiene** — AI assistant artifacts (`.claude/`, `.codex/`, etc.) untracked from the repo and added to `.gitignore`.

### Forge Integration (Phase 8)

Full daily-dev-workflow parity with GitHub and GitLab web UIs, behind a clean provider abstraction.

**MR/PR Enhancements (8.2)** — 11 new forge methods. Add/remove labels and reviewers post-creation, mark draft ↔ ready, reopen closed MR/PRs, resolve / unresolve GitLab discussion threads, and check out an MR/PR branch locally via `TaskManager`-streamed CLI output. The detail panel gains `LabelPicker`, `ReviewerPicker`, draft toggle, reopen button, per-comment resolve controls, and a "Checkout locally" action.

**Issues (8.3)** — Complete issue management as a new sidebar vertical. List / get / create / edit / close / reopen / comment plus assignees, labels, and milestones via 13 new trait methods. New `IssueView`, `IssueList`, `IssueDetail`, `CreateIssueDialog`, `AssigneePicker`, `MilestonePicker` components. Generic shared `LabelPicker` and `Xrefs` components plus a new `xrefs.ts` utility that auto-links `#NNN`, `!MMM`, `@user`, and short SHAs inside any text body.

**CI/CD Control (8.4)** — Actions on top of the existing Pipelines view. Trigger, retry, retry-failed-only, per-job retry, cancel, and list-workflows via six new `CiProvider` methods implemented over reqwest. `PipelineList` gets a "Run Workflow" button and row context menu; `PipelineDetail` gains action buttons and per-job retry. New `TriggerWorkflowDialog` with dynamic input form. GitHub PAT `workflow` scope hint surfaced in provider setup.

**Releases (8.5)** — Release management as its own vertical. 9 new trait methods including asset upload that streams via `TaskManager` for non-blocking progress. New `ReleaseView`, `ReleaseList`, `ReleaseDetail`, `CreateReleaseDialog`, `AssetUploadProgress` components plus an atomic `create_tag_and_release` flow that pushes the tag and creates the release in one streamed task. The cross-reference parser is extended to recognise release tags against a live tag cache.

**ForgeProvider Trait (8.1)** — New `forge-provider` crate extracts the `ForgeProvider` trait and shared types (`MrPr`, `Issue`, `Release`, `Label`, `User`, `Milestone`, `Comment`, …) with a `ForgeError` enum. `cli-provider` split into `GitHubCli` and `GitLabCli` structs each implementing the trait. `build_forge_provider(AppState) → Arc<dyn ForgeProvider>`. Zero user-visible change; foundation for 8.2–8.5.

### Bundled CLI Binaries (Phase 7.2)

BeardGit now ships `gh` (v2.62.0) and `glab` (v1.46.1) as Tauri sidecars on macOS arm64, Linux x64, and Windows x64 — no manual install required. `scripts/download-cli-binaries.js` pulls pinned binaries from the official release URLs; the Build and Release pipelines fetch the matrix-specific target before `tauri-action`. `resolve_cli_binary()` checks the sidecar location first and falls back to the system PATH, so existing installations keep working. Validated end-to-end across all four platforms.

### Terminal Enhancements (Phase 7.1)

- **OSC 7 cwd auto-detection** — terminals emit their current working directory on every prompt; when the cwd matches an open project path, the terminal tab auto-links to that project's composite tab.
- **AI provider auto-detection** — a lightweight polling loop detects when a terminal launches `claude`, `codex`, or `opencode` and updates the tab label plus brand icon dynamically.

### UI Polish & Bug Fixes (Phase 7.6)

- **Bisect graph integration** — good/bad/current/skipped commits get colored overlays in the canvas graph; right-click a commit for "Mark as good / bad / skip".
- **Worktree lock / unlock** — full `git worktree lock` / `unlock` wired through `git-engine` with context menu controls.
- **Worktree "Open in graph"** — navigates the graph view to the worktree's branch.
- **AI Config Editor live reload** — new `watcher::ai_config` module picks up external edits to `settings.json`, `agents/*.md`, `skills/*/SKILL.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` files; the editor refreshes without losing in-progress changes.
- **AI Sessions "Focus"** — focuses the linked terminal tab if the session has one; otherwise launches `claude --resume <sessionId>` in a new PTY terminal.

### Infrastructure (Phase 7.5)

- **Log rotation** — `storage::logging::purge_old_logs()` auto-removes `beardgit.*.log` files older than 7 days on startup (async, non-blocking). Legacy `beardgit.log.*` files from pre-rename installs are also purged by age.
- **Tracing on git writes** — 41 `#[instrument]` spans on `git-engine` write operations (bisect / operations / conflict / reset / clean / remote / worktree / submodule / interactive_rebase). Sensitive fields (commit bodies, PR descriptions, PAT tokens) excluded via `skip(...)`.
- **Tracing on Tauri commands** — 80 `#[instrument(name = "cmd::…")]` spans across 19 command modules. Hierarchical names make log grepping trivial.

### Performance (Phase 7.7)

- **Graph render profiler** — six `performance.mark` pairs around the render loop plus a dev-only FPS overlay toggled with `Ctrl+Shift+P`. Measurement infrastructure for future optimisations without runtime overhead in production bundles.
- **Interactive terminal pool** — 3-deep `xterm.js` instance pool recycles terminals across tab open/close. Faster tab spawn, lower GC pressure.
- **CodeMirror language cache** — module-level `Map<string, Extension>` short-circuits repeated dynamic imports per file extension. Second-and-subsequent opens of a language are instant.

### Code Quality (Phase 7.3)

The remaining items from Phase 6.3 plus anything picked up along the way. Generic `<List>` component now backs 10 consumers (Branch / Tag / Stash / Reflog / MrPr / Worktree / Submodule / Release / Issue / AiSession). `fetchIntoStore` / `fetchListIntoStore` / `fetchPageIntoStore` helpers consumed by 10 stores. Two residual `serde_json::from_str` call sites in `cli-provider/src/{github,gitlab}/mr_pr.rs` swapped for the shared `run_json` helper.

### E2E Testing (Phase 7.4 + follow-up)

Full WebdriverIO + `tauri-driver` suite covering every major vertical. 9 spec files, ~53 tests: app-launch, navigation, golden-path, and regression suites for graph / branches / staging / terminal / bisect / settings. 6 new page objects, data-testid attributes across the UI, and a Linux `e2e-tests` job in `ci.yml`. Follow-up pass in the same release cycle fixed every layer end-to-end: ESM `__dirname` shim for wdio v9, specs glob resolution, tauri-driver hostname/port, workspace-root binary path, `VITE_BEARDGIT_E2E` frontend hook, and switching to `tauri build --debug --no-bundle` so the frontend actually embeds. A new Docker harness (`e2e/Dockerfile` + `npm run e2e:docker`) lets macOS contributors run the full suite locally in ~1–2 min per iteration.

### Provider Architecture Cleanup (Phase 9)

Pure refactor. `provider/lib.rs` (883 LOC of trait + types + kind + error) split into `traits.rs` / `types.rs` / `kind.rs` / `error.rs` / `http_helpers.rs` / `mock.rs`; `lib.rs` is now 43 LOC of re-exports. `cli-provider/src/{github,gitlab}.rs` (~800 LOC each) converted to directory modules with per-vertical submodules (`mr_pr`, `labels`, `reviewers`, `lifecycle`, `discussions`, `checkout`, `issues`, `releases`). The `impl ForgeProvider` block stays in `mod.rs` as pure delegation to feature-scoped methods — no file exceeds 400 LOC. A CI grep guard in `ci.yml` enforces that `provider` and `forge-provider` never import `reqwest`, `tokio`, `tauri`, or `hyper`. Shared HTTP primitives (`api_error`, `retry_after_secs`, `trim_base_url`) extracted into `provider::http_helpers` and consumed by both `gitlab-api` and `github-api`. `crates/CLAUDE.md` refreshed with the new layout and an "Adding a new forge capability" walkthrough.

### Security

- `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` clean. Override added for `serialize-javascript` (wdio transitive dep) that upstream hadn't patched yet.

### Tooling

- `npm run e2e:docker` (plus `:rebuild` and `:shell`) — one-command local E2E.
- `e2e/README.md` documents the happy-path authoring pattern so test authors have a template.

---

### Phase 6 — Bisect, CLI Auth, AI Views, Multi-Provider, Code Quality

(Previously drafted as a standalone `[0.1.8]` release; folded into the unified `[0.1.8]` cut since it never tagged separately.)

**Git Bisect**

- Visual bisect workflow with good/bad/skip controls and progress indicator
- Auto-bisect mode: provide a test command, BeardGit runs `git bisect run` and reports the culprit
- New `git-engine` bisect module with full lifecycle (start, good, bad, skip, reset, log)
- 8 new Tauri commands, dedicated store, 2 Svelte components (BisectWorkflow, AutoBisectDialog)

**CLI Auth (gh/glab)**

- `gh auth status` and `glab auth status` detection — shows CLI login state in Settings
- Terminal-based login flow: "Login with CLI" opens interactive `gh auth login` / `glab auth login` in a PTY tab
- Unified Authentication settings page combining Token Auth and CLI Auth sections
- New `cli-provider` auth module with status parsing and terminal login commands

**AI Config Editor**

- Dual file tree (project-scoped + user-scoped) showing all AI config files

**AI Sessions**

- Project-scoped session list showing active and recent Claude Code sessions
- File watcher on `~/.claude/sessions/` with auto-refresh on changes
- Session metadata: model, start time, duration, token usage, status (active/completed)

**AI Worktree Enrichment**

- `EnrichedWorktree` type combining git worktree data with AI provider status
- AI badges on worktrees created by Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode
- Context menu with cleanup action for orphaned AI worktrees

**Codex & OpenCode Providers**

- New `codex` crate: full `AiProvider` implementation with binary detection, command building, and config discovery
- New `opencode` crate: full `AiProvider` implementation with binary detection, command building, and config discovery
- Both wired into `app-core` provider factory with automatic detection
- Dynamic terminal dropdown: only shows providers detected on the system
- Codex brand color corrected (#10a37f → #ffffff)

**Structured Error Logging**

- Structured file logging via `tracing` with `tracing-appender` daily rotation
- Logs written to `~/.local/share/com.beardgit.app/logs/` (platform-appropriate data dir)
- New `ErrorDialog` component with copy-error-to-clipboard and open-log-file actions
- All dialogs (Confirm, Clean, CreateMrPr, PatchPreview, TagCreate, CreateWorktree) upgraded with error display

**Composite Tab Upgrade**

- Multi-segment tabs: N terminals + worktrees per project in a single composite tab
- Fixed segment ordering: Project → Worktrees → AI Terminals → Terminals
- Terminal button always adds to the active project's composite tab instead of creating standalone tabs

**Code Quality — commands.rs Split**

- Split monolithic `commands.rs` (3,267 LOC) into 24 feature-based modules under `commands/`
- Modules: advanced, bisect, branch, ci, clean, cli_auth, commit, config, conflict, diff, gitignore, graph, helpers, logging, mod, mr_pr, patch, project, provider_auth, reflog, remote, repository, settings, staging, stash, submodule, tag, theme, worktree
- Extracted shared `dialog.css` (93 lines) replacing duplicated dialog styles across 7 components
- New `fetchIntoStore` utility for consistent store-loading patterns

**E2E Test Infrastructure**

- WebdriverIO + `tauri-driver` configuration for end-to-end testing
- Fixture repo setup script (`e2e/fixtures/setup.sh`) for reproducible test environments
- Page objects: `sidebar.page.ts`, `graph.page.ts`
- Initial specs: `app-launch.spec.ts`, `navigation.spec.ts`

**Bug Fixes & Polish**

- AI Config file tree correctly distinguishes project vs user scope
- AI Sessions auto-cleanup on component destroy (watcher unsubscribe)
- CreateConfigDialog validates file paths and prevents duplicates
- Store helpers centralized with `fetchIntoStore` reducing boilerplate across stores

## [0.1.7] — AI Provider Integration, Changes Redesign, UI Polish

**AI Provider Architecture**

- New `ai-provider` crate: `AiProvider` trait with 17 methods across 7 capability groups (identity, detection, headless execution, specialized actions, interactive launch, session/worktree introspection, config/attribution)
- Shared types: `AiProviderKind`, `AiSession`, `AiWorktree`, `AiConfigFile`, `ExecuteOptions`, `AttributionPattern`
- Trait builds `std::process::Command` objects without executing — execution delegated to `TaskManager` (headless) or `TerminalManager` (interactive)
- Default implementations return empty/None/NotSupported — providers override what they support

**Claude Code (First Provider)**

- New `claude-code` crate implementing `AiProvider` for Claude Code CLI
- Binary detection via `which` + version parsing from `claude --version`
- Repo artifact detection (`.claude/` directory, `CLAUDE.md` file)
- Headless command builder: `--print`, `--output-format`, `--model`, `--max-budget-usd`
- Interactive launch: spawns `claude` binary directly in PTY terminal
- Worktree support: `--worktree [name]` flag
- Session introspection: parses `~/.claude/sessions/*.json`, PID liveness checks (`kill(pid, 0)` on Unix)
- Worktree introspection: `git worktree list --porcelain` parser, filters `worktree-*` branches, status detection (Active/Clean/Orphaned)
- Config discovery: user/project/local settings.json, `.claude/agents/*.md`, `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`, CLAUDE.md hierarchy
- Commit attribution: detects `Authored-by:` footer, `Co-authored-by:` trailer with Claude/Anthropic mention, author name matching

**16 Tauri Commands**

- Detection: `ai_get_providers`, `ai_get_repo_status`, `ai_refresh_detection`
- Headless actions (via TaskManager): `ai_generate_commit_message`, `ai_analyze_code`, `ai_generate_pr_description`, `ai_review_code`, `ai_review_pr`
- Interactive launch (via TerminalManager): `ai_launch_interactive`, `ai_launch_worktree`
- Introspection: `ai_list_sessions`, `ai_list_worktrees`, `ai_cleanup_worktree`, `ai_get_config_files`
- Preference: `ai_get_preferred_provider`, `ai_set_preferred_provider`

**AI Provider Settings**

- New "AI Provider" section in Settings replacing the WIP "Editor" section
- Shows all known providers (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode) with detection status
- Detected providers show version and "Detected" badge; unavailable ones are greyed out
- Click to set default provider, click again to reset to auto-detect
- Preference persisted in `AppConfig.preferred_ai_provider` across restarts
- Refresh button to re-scan PATH for provider binaries

**AI Button Validation**

- AI Commit Message button now shows a warning toast when no staged changes exist
- AI Code Review button now shows a warning toast when no changes exist at all
- Previously both buttons silently triggered tasks with no input

**Terminal AI Launch**

- Terminal dropdown "Claude Code" now calls `ai_launch_interactive` — spawns the `claude` binary directly in PTY (Claude Code starts automatically)
- Terminal tabs show Claude Code SVG brand icon (coral `#d97757`) instead of generic terminal icon
- Brand-colored status dots: Claude (#d97757), Codex (#10a37f), OpenCode (#8b8b8b)
- Same icon treatment in both standalone `TerminalTab` and composite tab terminal segments
- `TerminalTabInfo` extended with optional `provider` field for brand identification

**Changes Section Redesign**

- Pinned commit box at bottom with toolbar row: amend toggle, AI buttons, overflow menu
- AI Commit Message button (purple accent) with loading spinner; Code Review button (blue accent)
- Overflow menu: Create Patch, Clean, History (reflog), Push — replacing scattered buttons
- Commit message textarea with Cmd+Enter shortcut
- Single commit button replacing separate stage+commit actions

**Reflog Section Overhaul**

- Fixed broken "Create Branch" context menu action — was creating branch at HEAD instead of at the reflog entry's commit. New `create_branch_at(name, oid)` backend operation
- Fixed misleading "Checkout" action — was performing `reset --mixed` (destructive). New `checkout_detached(oid)` backend operation for proper detached HEAD checkout
- Fixed selection model — `selectedReflogOid` used just the OID which is not unique across reflog entries. Switched to index-based selection
- Removed duplicate `repo-changed` listeners — SplitView now handles lifecycle exclusively
- Added action buttons to detail pane: Checkout, Create Branch, Reset (dropdown with Soft/Mixed/Hard), Copy SHA
- Added refresh button to list header
- Context menu actions now refresh the reflog list after operations
- Selection cleared when navigating away to prevent stale state on return
- File diff panel: clicking a file in the reflog commit detail now shows a resizable diff editor below

**Submodule Management — Add & Remove**

- New "Add Submodule" button in header — opens inline form with URL and path inputs
- New `add_submodule(url, path)` backend operation (`git submodule add`)
- New "Remove Submodule" in right-click context menu with confirmation dialog
- New `remove_submodule(path)` backend operation (`git submodule deinit -f` + `git rm -f`)
- Empty state no longer blocks the "Add Submodule" button

**UI Polish**

- Folder icons changed from orange to blue for better visual cohesion
- Tab badge style changed from solid orange pill to subtle green tint with green text
- Tab hover tooltips with project snapshot (branch, changes, last commit)
- Project snapshot cache for instant tooltip display
- Task panel command bar truncated to single line with ellipsis (fixes output being pushed off-screen by long AI commands)

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed task panel output not visible when AI commands have long prompts (command bar had no max-height)
- Fixed `width: 100%` missing on SplitView — right pane not reaching container edge in flex layouts
- Fixed graph tooltip positioning and content
- Fixed terminal resize on tab switch
- Fixed project switch clearing stale data (reflog, conflict state, diffs)
- Fixed unstaged file diff preview not loading after project tab switch
- Removed gitignore editor component (functionality preserved via context menu)

**E2E Test Infrastructure**

- Global vitest setup mocking `@tauri-apps/api/core`, `@tauri-apps/api/event`, `@tauri-apps/api/window`, `@tauri-apps/plugin-dialog`
- Configurable `mockInvokeResponse()` helper for per-test IPC mocking
- 6 E2E workflow test suites: repo-open, staging-commit, branch-ops, tag-ops, stash-ops, ai-provider
- 103 new tests (149 total frontend tests, all passing)

## [0.1.6] — Interactive Terminal Tabs, Composite Tabs, Sidebar Collapse

**Composite Segmented Tabs**

- Project + linked terminal merge into a single segmented pill tab: `[● Repo | ⌨ Terminal]`
- Each segment independently clickable, closeable (hover-only ✕), and middle-click closeable
- Closing a segment reverts the composite to a simple tab (project-only or terminal-only)
- Terminal opens in-place — project tab is promoted to composite, not a new tab at the end
- Shell exit auto-removes the terminal segment, reverting to a simple project tab
- Cmd+W closes the active segment of a composite tab (not the whole tab)
- Standalone terminal tabs remain for "New terminal in ~" (not linked to any project)

**Interactive Terminal Tabs**

- Full interactive xterm.js terminal wired to Rust PTY backend (keyboard input, resize, base64 byte streaming)
- Terminal split button in the actions area: left (terminal icon) opens terminal, right (chevron) opens dropdown
- Dropdown options: "New terminal in ~", Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode — with official SVG brand logos and hardcoded brand colors (#d97757, #10a37f, #8b8b8b)
- Claude logo uses official Anthropic symbol (CC0 public domain from Wikimedia Commons)
- NerdFont icons render correctly in terminal (NerdFontSymbols added to xterm.js fontFamily)
- Cmd+T shortcut to open a new terminal tab
- Terminal tabs auto-close when the shell process exits
- Fetch/Pull/Push buttons hidden when a terminal tab is active

**Sidebar Collapse**

- New collapse toggle button at bottom of sidebar with chevron icon
- Collapsed mode: icon-only (44px width) with smooth 150ms CSS transition
- Tooltips on hover when collapsed
- Cmd+B keyboard shortcut to toggle
- Collapse state persisted in AppConfig across restarts

**Performance**

- Graph viewport cached per project — instant tab switching with no loading spinner for the graph view
- Auto-navigate to graph on project tab switch — prevents stale pipeline/changes data from previous project

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed: recent projects list empty on first use — now populated when opening a project, not just when closing one
- Fixed: unstaged file diff preview not loading after project tab switch (diffs now auto-refresh on file click)
- Fixed: close button icons inconsistent — standardized to `\uF00D` (nf-fa-times) across all tabs and panels
- Fixed: + button icon inconsistent — standardized to `\uF067` (nf-fa-plus)
- Fixed: icons not vertically centered in Fetch/Pull/Push/Terminal action buttons
- Fixed: tab close buttons oversized with circle hover — now smaller, highlight-only on hover
- Fixed: + button popup not closing when clicking outside
- Sidebar navigation from a terminal tab automatically switches to the most recent project tab

## [0.1.5] — Terminal Core + Theme Redesign

**Terminal Core (xterm.js) + Theme Redesign**

- New `terminal` Rust crate with PTY lifecycle management via `portable-pty`
- Cross-platform shell detection (zsh/bash on Unix, powershell/cmd on Windows)
- `TerminalManager` with spawn, write, resize, kill, kill_all operations
- Tauri commands and event bridge for terminal sessions (base64-encoded byte streaming)
- Reusable `<Terminal>` Svelte component (xterm.js with WebGL, fit, web-links, search addons)
- Read-only xterm.js instance pool (max 3: 2 visible + 1 warm) for zero-lag view switching
- TaskPanel output migrated from manual ANSI-to-HTML to xterm.js read-only terminal
- JobLog (CI pipeline logs) migrated from manual ANSI-to-HTML to xterm.js read-only terminal
- Theme system redesigned: 18 base colors (background + foreground + 16 ANSI) replace 12 semantic colors
- All 14 TOML themes updated with explicit ANSI color palettes
- Semantic UI colors now auto-derived from base palette (DerivedColors struct)
- Direct xterm.js ITheme mapping from base colors (no derivation needed for terminal)
- Retired `ansi.ts` (250+ lines) — replaced by native xterm.js rendering + lightweight `stripAnsi()` utility

**Auto-Update System**

- Tauri updater plugin checks GitHub Releases for updates on app launch
- Two-step update flow: toast notification → Download → Restart (non-disruptive)
- Download progress shown in toast with percentage
- Updater signing keys configured in CI release workflow

**Toast Notifications**

- Reusable toast notification system (bottom-right, max 3, stackable)
- Types: success, error, warning, info with auto-dismiss
- Used by auto-updater, extensible for future notifications

**Multi-File Selection in Changes**

- Per-file checkboxes in both staged and unstaged file lists
- Select All header checkbox with indeterminate state
- Header action swaps contextually: Stage All / Stage Selected (N) and Unstage All / Unstage Selected (N)
- Selection clears on refresh

**Bug Fixes**

- Commits now use git config identity (user.name/user.email) instead of hardcoded author
- Untracked directories show individual files instead of collapsed folder entry (recurse_untracked_dirs)
- README prerequisites and architecture table accuracy fixes

## [0.1.4] - 2026-04-09 — UI Polish, Layout Consistency & Bug Fixes

**3-Way Merge Editor (IntelliJ-style)**

- Full 3-panel layout: Theirs (Incoming) | Result | Ours (Current)
- Custom 3-way diff engine with LCS-based line alignment and chunk classification
- Non-conflicting changes auto-applied to the result on open
- Conflict placeholder lines in center with accept/ignore buttons on each side

- Hybrid curves: filled bezier when sparse, thin connector lines when dense (> 4 conflicts)
- Dynamic connector gap width (24px normal, 40px for many conflicts)
- Color scheme: green (added), purple (conflict), blue (center placeholder), active highlight (brighter)
- Chunk-aware scroll sync: center drives side panels based on line mapping, not proportional
- Side panel wheel events redirected to center for consistent behavior
- Smooth scroll animations on side panels during sync
- SVG connectors update on scroll, accept/ignore, undo, and window resize
- Undo support: Cmd/Ctrl+Z undoes accept/ignore operations, toolbar undo button

- Syntax highlighting in all panels (language-aware via filename)

**Merge Request / Pull Request Improvements**

- List layout aligned with pipeline section pattern (3-column horizontal rows with state icon, title, time)
- Removed filter tabs (Open/Closed/Merged/All), replaced with SearchBar state filter (default: state:open)
- Added search/filter bar with state, author, branch, and label filters
- Markdown rendering in descriptions and comments (minimal parser + allowlist-based XSS sanitizer, links open externally)
- Redesigned merge action buttons: split-button with dropdown menu for merge strategy (merge/squash/rebase)
- Added refresh button and "no provider" empty state
- Provider readiness guard prevents empty list on startup

**Layout Consistency**

- Migrated Reflog view to SplitView (resizable sidebar, consistent with Tags/Stash/Branches/MR)
- Migrated Pipelines view to SplitView (replaces custom resize logic in +page.svelte)
- Pipeline job log pane is now resizable with a drag handle and has a close button
- Standardized icon-only buttons across all views: 14px, no border, color-only hover (refresh, close, nav buttons)
- Worktree, CommitDetail, DiffEditor, StagingDiffEditor, BlameView buttons all aligned
- Tag push button uses green hover (from theme --accent-green) consistently in both list and detail
- Worktree delete button: same color as others by default, red highlight on hover only
- Graph header separator line now reaches full width (border on container, not SearchBar)

**Git Config Editor**

- Empty values show italic "empty" label in light grey instead of em dash
- Clicking an empty field and typing nothing no longer saves an empty value
- Tooltips use i18n keys instead of hardcoded English

**Task System**

- Task popover now appears correctly (fixed position + click-outside race condition)
- Task output loaded from backend on selection (fixes empty output for completed tasks)
- Panel output shows executed command at top ($ git fetch origin)
- Three distinct empty states: "Select a task", "No output", output content
- Correct NerdFont icons for expand/collapse/close buttons
- Removed output preview from popover (kept in full panel only)

**Authentication**

- GitHub/GitLab CLI OAuth login disabled until terminal integration (PAT-only for now)
- OAuth errors now shown to user instead of silent fallback to PAT

**Keyboard Shortcuts**

- `?` shortcut now works globally (even when editor is focused)
- Fixed shift-key matching for shortcuts like `?` that inherently need Shift
- Help overlay: Escape key closes the popup, larger fonts, bigger close button
- Sidebar highlight syncs with keyboard navigation (Cmd+1-6)

**Other Fixes**

- Reflog empty-state message properly centered
- Hardcoded hex colors replaced with theme variables (--accent-green, --accent-red) in tag buttons
- Markdown sanitizer uses allowlist approach; links get target="_blank"
- MR merge dropdown closes on click-outside
- Conflict marker regex handles Windows \r\n line endings
- MR filtered-empty state shows "No results match your filter" instead of generic message
- MR and reflog state cleared on project switch (prevents stale data)
- CreateMrPrDialog backdrop changed to button for a11y compliance
- All svelte-check warnings resolved (0 errors, 0 warnings)

- StagingDiffEditor with per-hunk and per-line checkboxes, select all/deselect all
- Backend builds unified diff patches from selections and applies via `git apply --cached`
- Discard with confirmation dialog (destructive action)

**Blame + File History**

- Blame view with per-line gutter annotations (author, OID, relative date)
- Commit grouping in gutter — consecutive lines from same commit share annotation block
- Click OID in gutter to reload blame at that commit
- File history panel with `git log --follow` — shows all commits that touched the file
- Rename detection — shows "renamed from" badge when file was moved
- Click any commit in history to view blame at that point in time
- Right-click any file in staging area or commit detail → "Blame" / "File History"

**Rebase**

- Non-interactive rebase from branch context menu ("Rebase onto this branch") and graph context menu ("Rebase current onto here")
- Confirmation dialog before rebase; conflicts route to merge editor automatically

**Interactive Rebase**

- Visual commit list editor from graph context menu ("Interactive rebase from here")
- Per-commit action dropdown: pick, squash, fixup, edit, drop
- Drag-to-reorder commits with color-coded left border per action

- Total: 14 built-in themes (10 dark, 4 light)
- Complementary theme pairing for OS auto-switch — each theme maps to a light/dark counterpart so toggling OS appearance picks the right pair (e.g., Catppuccin Mocha ↔ Catppuccin Latte)

**Performance**

- `Arc<str>` for commit OIDs in graph-builder — eliminates ~10 String clones per commit in the 100K+ commit hot path
- GitLab stage grouping optimized from O(n²) to O(n) via HashMap index

**Code Quality & Deduplication**

- Replaced 30+ hardcoded CSS color values with theme variables across 5 components
- Added `--overlay-accent-*` CSS variables for consistent overlay theming
- Consolidated 3 inline date formatters into shared `formatDate()`/`formatDateTime()` utilities
- Replaced manual debounce in TagList with shared `debounce()` utility

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed stale detail panels when switching repository tabs — graph, branch, tag, stash, blame, and worktree state now fully cleared on tab switch
- Conflict status now refreshed on repo tab switch
- Branch commit list not taking full available width (missing `min-width: 0`)
- Diff close button hidden when file path is too long (added overflow handling + `flex-shrink: 0`)

**Settings**

- Removed Repository section (remote management) — will return with gh/glab CLI integration

**CI/CD**

- Release pipeline auto-syncs version from git tag — no manual version bumps needed
- Strips non-numeric pre-release suffixes for Windows MSI compatibility (e.g., `v0.1.2-beta` → `0.1.2`)

**Performance & Windows Fixes**

- All 22 git CLI-backed commands now run on background threads (async + spawn_blocking) — UI never freezes during git operations
- Added CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag on Windows to prevent CMD console flash when spawning git processes
- Covers: tags, stashes, diffs, conflict operations, remotes, worktrees

**Testing**
