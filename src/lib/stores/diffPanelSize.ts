/**
 * Diff-panel sizing store.
 *
 * The bottom diff panel (commit/branch/reflog/PR-MR file diffs) is
 * height-resizable via `ResizableDiffPanel` (its outer edges always
 * stick to the surrounding columns). The height lives here —
 * module-level rather than component-local — so it persists when the user
 * switches between views (each view mounts a fresh panel instance, but
 * they should all open at the size the user last set). Kept in memory
 * only, matching the previous behaviour where the height reset on restart.
 *
 * Resetting (double-click or Home on the handle) is the handle's own
 * `defaultSize`, so there is no reset function here to drift out of sync
 * with it.
