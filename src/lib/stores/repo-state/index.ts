/**
 * RepoState container — one per-repo state object keyed by project path.
 *
 * The app has multiple repo tabs, but feature stores historically held the
 * *active* repo's state in module-level singletons, each responsible for
 * surviving tab switches with its own path-keyed cache (branchCache,
 * viewportCache, …). Correctness was convention, and the convention broke
 * (see the isolation bug documented in `project-cache.ts` + spec 08).
 *
 * Here, per-repo state lives in **one** container keyed by path. Switching
 * tabs is a pointer swap (`setActiveRepoPath`), not a choreography of
 * save/restore calls across stores. Feature stores (`branches.ts`,
 * `changes.ts`, …) become thin facades that proxy the *active* RepoState's
 * slice via {@link activeField}, so components don't change.
 *
 * ── Runes vs writable fallback ────────────────────────────────────────
 * The spec suggests slices as Svelte 5 `$state` rune classes in `.svelte.ts`
 * files. We instead use plain classes whose fields are Svelte `writable`s
 * because the facade MUST expose the `Writable` store contract (components
 * and the 30+ existing store tests do `$store`, `store.set()`, `get(store)`
 * with synchronous semantics). Bridging `$state` back to that contract needs
 * per-field `toStore`/`$effect.root` wrappers whose flush timing under
 * jsdom+vitest doesn't match `writable`'s synchronous `get()`. writable-backed
 * slices give per-repo isolation trivially (each RepoState owns distinct
 * writable instances) and stay 100% testable. The runes consolidation can
 * happen later, per the spec's "don't chase the long tail".
