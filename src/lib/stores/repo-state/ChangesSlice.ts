/**
 * Per-repo staging-area state (RepoState slice).
 *
 * Holds one repo's file statuses, per-file diff stats, the open staging
 * diff, the commit-message draft, and the checkbox selection for each
 * list. Because every open repo owns its own `ChangesSlice`, the checkbox
 * selection now survives tab switches per-repo — previously it lived in a
 * module-global store that `clearChangesState` wiped on every switch, so
 * switching repos and back dropped the selection (spec 08 isolation bug).
 *
 * Fields are plain Svelte `writable`s (not `$state` runes) — see the note
 * in `./index.ts` for why the fallback was chosen for this migration step.
