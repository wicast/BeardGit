/**
 * Shared task descriptor consumed by the unified tasks drawer.

 * Produced by three independent bridges in `src/lib/stores/tasks.ts`:
 *
 * 1. Rust `TaskManager` events — streamed over the `task://update` Tauri
 *    channel from `crates/app-core/src/task_events.rs`. The wire payload
 *    (`TaskEvent` on the Rust side) mirrors this interface byte-for-byte
 *    after camelCase remapping (see the aggregator store for the mapper).
 * 2. The `aiBackgroundRuns` store — headless AI runs each projected
 *    through `aiSessionToTaskEntry`.
 * 3. The `autoUpdate` store's `updateTask` derived — the in-app updater's
 *    lifecycle, mapped to a single stable entry with id `"auto-update"`.
 *
 * Kept deliberately narrow so every producer can map its feature-specific
 * state into one stable shape without pulling in feature-specific types.
