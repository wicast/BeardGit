/**
 * Windowed-list arithmetic, shared by every list that mounts one row per
 * item.
 *
 * This was inlined in `common/List.svelte`, which is a whole panel —
 * header, filter bar, refresh button, single selection. The lists that
 * actually grow without bound are not panels of that shape: the changes
 * list has checkboxes and shift-range selection, the workdir tree has
 * expandable directories. They could not consume the component, so they
 * rendered every row. Extracting the arithmetic is what lets them share
 * the behaviour without inheriting the layout.
 *
 * Deliberately pure: no runes, no DOM. Each consumer keeps its own
 * `$state` for `scrollTop` / `viewportHeight` and calls this from a
 * `$derived`, which also makes the edge cases testable without a browser.
