//! AI provider trait and shared types for AI coding tool integration.
//!
//! This crate defines the [`AiProvider`] trait — the contract for all AI tool
//! backends (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode). It is intentionally Tauri-free
//! and async-free so it can be tested and reused independently.
//!
//! # Design Principle: Command-Building
//!
//! The trait builds [`std::process::Command`] objects but never executes them.
//! Execution is handled by `app-core` via `TaskManager` (headless) or
//! `TerminalManager` (interactive). Detection methods (`detect_binary`,
//! `version`) do perform blocking filesystem I/O — they are called
//! infrequently (startup, tab switch) and are fast local operations.

// to what a CLI provider would receive. Change a prompt here and both
// backends pick it up.
