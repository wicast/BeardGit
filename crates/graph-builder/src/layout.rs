//! Lane-based layout engine for the commit graph.
//!
//! [`GraphLayout::compute`] walks the [`Dag`] in insertion order (newest-first)
//! and assigns each node a **row** (its position in the list) and a **lane**
//! (its horizontal column in the graph). Lanes are recycled when a branch merges
//! back into another, keeping the graph compact. The maximum number of concurrent
//! lanes is capped at [`DEFAULT_MAX_LANES`] (overridable per layout via
//! [`GraphLayout::compute_with_max_lanes`]) to prevent the graph from spreading
//! too wide on repositories with many parallel branches.
