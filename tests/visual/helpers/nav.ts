/**
 * Sidebar navigation for the visual suite — click, then wait for the view
 * to actually be there.
 *
 * ## Why the wait lives here
 *
 * Half the views in `+page.svelte` are wrapped in `LazyComponent`, which
 * dynamic-imports the panel's chunk. Until the import resolves it renders
 * `.lazy-placeholder` — a spinner on an otherwise empty main area. Click
 * and screenshot, and that spinner is what you get.
 *
 * That would be a loud failure if it only ever broke a comparison. It is
 * not: `toHaveScreenshot` polls against the baseline on disk, so a
 * baseline *recorded* mid-load matches on an early poll and passes
 * forever, while a correctly recorded one fails visibly. Getting it wrong
 * is silent and permanent; getting it right is noisy. Three baselines
 * (`dark-pipelines`, `dark-settings`, `dark-ai-sessions`) were recorded
 * that way and Settings — one of the largest surfaces in the app — had no
 * coverage that could ever fail.
 *
 * So the wait belongs on the shared route helper rather than in whichever
 * spec happened to notice, and it has to be a *positive* signal first:
 * waiting only for the placeholder to detach passes instantly when it has
 * not been attached yet, which is the same bug one tick earlier.

 * entry uniformly without needing to know which container the item lives
 * in.

  // 1. Positive edge: the click's reactive pass has landed. `LazyComponent`
  //    renders its placeholder in that same pass, so from here on "no
  //    placeholder" means "loaded", not "not started yet".
  await expect(navItem(page, label)).toHaveClass(/\bactive\b/, { timeout: 10_000 });

  //    fall through immediately.

    .locator(".lazy-placeholder")
    .waitFor({ state: "detached", timeout: 15_000 });

  // 3. A failed chunk renders "Failed to load panel." — which is a
  //    perfectly stable thing to screenshot, and exactly the kind of wrong
  //    baseline this helper exists to prevent.
  await expect(page.locator(".lazy-error")).toHaveCount(0);

  // 4. …and so is a view that mounted fine but whose data threw. Repo
  //    settings spent this whole branch baselined as a "Failed to load"
  //    card, because its fixture named a command that does not exist
  //    (`get_remote_repo_config`; the real one is
  //    `load_remote_repo_config`) and `cloneConfig(undefined)` threw into
  //    the store's own catch. Nothing above notices that: the chunk
  //    loaded, the view rendered, the render was stable.
  //
  //    Deliberately a short list of unambiguous failure strings rather
  //    than anything resembling "does this look wrong" — the app's own
  //    error-card title, plus the two shapes a thrown JS error takes when
  //    it reaches the UI as a message.

  // 5. Park the pointer. `click()` leaves it on the item, the nav list
  //    scrolls the active entry into view under it, and the row that ends
  //    up beneath the cursor renders `:hover` — a different row from the
  //    one that was clicked, and only sometimes repainted before the
  //    screenshot. That is a 5,400px difference in a 27px strip of the
  //    sidebar, run to run, in whichever tests happen to lose the race.
  //
  //    It never failed anything because `maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.01` allows
  //    12,960px. The five clean `--retries=0` runs I reported earlier were
  //    clean because of that budget, not because the renders agreed.
