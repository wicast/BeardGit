## § 01 — Manifesto

You ship code from **one keyboard**, not seventeen tabs. BeardGit is built on a simple premise: _everything you touch to release a change should live in one app._ Your commit graph. Your branches. Your staging. Your pull requests and merge requests on **GitHub and GitLab**. Your CI pipelines and deploy jobs. Your issues, labels, and releases. Your terminals. Your AI agents. Your **API requests**, committed alongside the code that calls them. Your **repo files**, edited in place. Close the browser tabs. Close the other clients. BeardGit is the **one window** you keep open.

---

## § 02 — What you get

### A canvas graph that scales

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/screenshots/graph-dark.png" alt="BeardGit canvas commit graph with branch lanes, merge curves, and author highlighting" width="100%" />
</p>

100K+ commits render smoothly via a viewport-sliced renderer. Branch lanes, merge curves, sync-state lines, author highlighting — all on HTML canvas, not DOM. `⌘F` filters by author, message, or ref; the graph re-lays out only for the matches. Three-way merge editor, interactive rebase, revert, amend, reset, cherry-pick, blame, reflog with recovery actions, and a visual `git bisect` with auto-mode that runs your test command at every step.

**Compare any ref against any ref.** Pick a base and a compare side — branch, tag, or SHA, with autocomplete — and get the commits it adds, an ahead/behind summary, the changed files, and a per-file diff. **Branch cleanup** flags local branches whose upstream is `[gone]` and offers a one-dialog bulk delete, with "merged into default" as an opt-in second group. **Commit signing** (SSH / GPG / X.509) is honoured when your git config asks for it; a **Test signing** button in Settings signs a throwaway commit and shows you the real error if it fails.

Pick a folder that isn't a repo yet and BeardGit offers to set it up in one shot: `git init`, drop a `.gitignore`, commit as **Initial commit**, create a matching repo on GitHub or GitLab, wire the remote, and push — every step independently optional, partial progress preserved on failure.

---

### Forge-native for GitHub and GitLab

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/screenshots/pull-requests-dark.png" alt="Pull request detail with CI pipeline status and inline review comments" width="100%" />
</p>

Create, edit, merge, approve, and comment on **PRs and MRs** with **per-file diff and inline review threads**. Manage issues, labels, milestones, assignees. Trigger, retry, retry-failed-only, cancel pipelines. Publish releases and stream asset uploads. Edit repo settings — description, homepage, topics, visibility, default branch, branch protection, labels — without leaving the app.

A clean `ForgeProvider` abstraction wraps `gh` and `glab`. Self-hosted **GitHub Enterprise** and **on-prem GitLab** work out of the box; auth is checked per-host so a VPN-only forge doesn't shadow a working one. Multi-instance friendly: a personal `gitlab.com` and a corporate self-hosted GitLab can coexist.

> Both CLIs ship bundled in every installer. No PATH dance, no setup.

---

### AI that runs in a worktree, not in your face

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/screenshots/ai-sessions-dark.png" alt="AI background run transcript inside a worktree with provider and prompt selection" width="100%" />
</p>

**Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode** — your local install, driven by BeardGit. Each background run lands on its own `ai/<provider>/<slug>` branch in an isolated worktree under `.beardgit/ai-worktrees/`, queued at a concurrency cap you set. Review, merge, or discard. The transcript stays in-app and survives tab switches; your main checkout stays untouched.

From any tab the active provider can also draft a commit message, review your staged changes, or review a PR — gated on "there's actually something to talk about" so you never get an empty reply.

---

### An `.http` workspace, in your repo

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/screenshots/requests-dark.png" alt="In-repo .http API testing workspace with environment files and response history" width="100%" />
</p>

Your API requests live next to the code that calls them. Plain `.http` files under `.beardgit/requests/`, committed with the rest of the project, so `git pull` shares them with the team. Environments split into commit-safe `_env/<name>.json`; secrets stay encrypted in BeardGit's local credential store, never in git.

When a forge provider is active, seven `forge_*` auto-variables (`forge_token`, `forge_host`, `forge_api_base`, `forge_owner`, `forge_repo`, `forge_branch`, `forge_commit_sha`) are available with zero setup, so hitting the API of the repo you're staring at is one click. JSON syntax highlighting, `{{var}}` autocomplete, **diff between any two responses from history**, and Copy-as cURL / fetch / HTTPie / wget. Cancel actually cancels the in-flight request.

---

### An in-app code editor

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/screenshots/editor-dark.png" alt="In-app CodeMirror code editor with snippets, JSON lint and inline color pickers" width="100%" />
</p>

Edit repo files without leaving BeardGit. CodeMirror 6 with per-language snippets (Rust, TS / JS, Python, Go), keyword completion, JSON lint with rules for `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`, inline color pickers in CSS, indent guides, and a gitignore-aware file tree. Save writes to disk; `⇧ Save` also stages it for the next commit. Right-click any file row in Changes, Branches, or Reflog and pick **Open in editor** to jump straight in.

---

### And the rest

- **Multi-repo tabs.** Heavy state (repo, layout, watcher) loads only for the active tab. A dozen open repos cost the same as one. `⌘1…⌘9` jumps between them; drag a tab to reorder.
- **Every section remembers where you left it.** Filters, scroll positions, split widths, collapsed folders, search chips, and half-written drafts (commit message, MR comment, stash message) survive leaving a view and coming back — per repo tab, for the length of the session. The editor keeps its open tabs and unsaved edits across views too.
- **Staging that works at line level.** Collapse a hunk, expand the whole file, stage or discard individual lines, arrow-key through the list, Shift-select a range, and stage / discard / stash the selection from the right-click menu.
- **Real terminals.** xterm.js + WebGL fed by a native Rust PTY. OSC 7 auto-links a terminal to the matching project tab. Foreground process polling detects when `claude` / `codex` / `opencode` start and updates the tab on the fly.
- **Themes and i18n.** 31 built-in themes, light and dark, plus your own as a TOML file — every accent flows from CSS tokens, including the graph. All three text rungs of every bundled theme clear WCAG AA, enforced by a test; a theme you write yourself is measured and reported, never rewritten. English and Spanish ship via [Paraglide](https://inlang.com/m/gerre34r/library-inlang-paraglideJs); adding a locale is a JSON file.
- **A sidebar that's yours.** Reorder navigation items, hide what you don't use, reset to the default. Layout persists app-wide.
- **Auto-update.** Tauri updater on the stable channel with diagnostics for endpoint and last-check timestamp — so you can tell a 404 apart from a DNS hiccup without leaving the app.
- **Local-only logs.** `tracing` with daily rotation and 7-day auto-purge to a per-platform path, and a live log-level switch (error / info / debug) in Settings → Advanced. The log path is included in the in-app error dialog; sharing a file is your call, never the app's.

## Who BeardGit is for

> Five minutes from download to first commit. No accounts, no logins, no "BeardGit Cloud."

**You'll like it if you:**

- Live on **GitHub _or_ GitLab** and want a first-class experience on either — not "GitHub plus a GitLab bolt-on."
- Test APIs against the repo you're staring at and hate context-switching to a separate API client.
- Run **Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode** and want them isolated in worktrees, not loose in your tree.
- Care that your git client doesn't ship a 200 MB Chromium runtime to render a sidebar.
- Want a polished GUI with **Linux as a first-class platform**, not an afterthought.

**You probably won't if you:**

- Live entirely on `git` CLI and `lazygit` — BeardGit is GUI-first.
- Need SVN, Mercurial, Perforce, or self-hosted Bitbucket — not supported.
- Want a paid product with phone support and an enterprise SSO portal — that's not this.

BeardGit is **free and source-available**. The CC BY-NC-SA license blocks reselling BeardGit _itself_ — using it commercially in your team is fine.

## Install in 30 seconds

Pre-built installers are published on every tagged release:

| Platform | Architecture  | Format      |
| -------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| macOS    | Apple Silicon | `.dmg`      |
| Linux    | x64           | `.AppImage` |
| Windows  | x64           | `.exe`      |

> **[→ Download the latest release](https://github.com/The3eard/BeardGit/releases/latest)**, pick your installer, and run it. `gh` and `glab` are bundled — no extra setup needed.

<details>
<summary><strong>First launch — unsigned builds (one-time setup)</strong></summary>

BeardGit is currently distributed without Apple or Microsoft code-signing certificates, so both operating systems will flag the app the first time you open it. The app is safe; the warnings exist because the binaries are not notarized/signed. You only need to do this once per install.

**macOS — "BeardGit is damaged" / "developer cannot be verified"**

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/BeardGit.app
```

Or right-click `BeardGit.app` → **Open** → click **Open** in the confirmation, or use **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway**.

**Windows — "Windows protected your PC" (SmartScreen)**

Click **More info** → **Run anyway**. The warning won't reappear on the same machine.

| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `main` | Mirrors the latest stable release. Auto-update endpoint points here.                                          |
| `beta` | Integration branch. Feature/fix branches merge here with `--no-ff`, then `main` is fast-forwarded on release. |

Day-to-day work happens on short-lived branches off `beta` (`feat/<thing>`, `fix/<thing>`, …). Don't batch features on a long-lived branch.
